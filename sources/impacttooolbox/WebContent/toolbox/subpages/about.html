	<h1>The project</h1>
	<h2>IMPACT: Integrated Method for Policy Making Using Argument
		Modelling and Computer Assisted Text Analysis</h2>
	<p>IMPACT is a European Framework 7 project (Grant Agreement No
		247228) in the ICT for Governance and Policy Modeling theme
		(ICT-2009.7.3). The project began January 1, 2010 and will run for
		three years.</p>
	<p>IMPACT is conducting original research to develop and integrate
		formal, computational models of policy and arguments about policy, to
		facilitate deliberations about policy at. These models are used to
		develop and evaluate this prototype of an argumentation toolbox for
		supporting open, inclusive and transparent deliberations about public
		policy.</p>
	<p>To support the analysis of policy proposals in an inclusive way,
		respecting the interests of all stakeholders, research on tools for
		reconstructing arguments from data resources distributed throughout
		the Internet is being conducted.</p>
	<p>Prior research on using argumentation schemes to generate
		focused surveys, minimizing noise and the need for manual moderation,
		is being extended in this project to support argumentation schemes
		needed for policy deliberations and generate surveys in multiple
		languages.</p>
	<p>Research on tools enabling stakeholders to simulate the legal
		effects of policy proposals in real and hypothetical cases is being
		conducted, using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Legal
		Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) to model policies.</p>
	<p>Finally, research is being conducted on how to visualize
		arguments about policy, building on previous research by the
		participants, but extended to visualize relationships between
		arguments and policies.</p>
