<P class="p0"><FONT class="ft0">Google's Contribution to the European Commission public consultation on "Copyright in the Knowledge Society"</FONT></P>
<P class="p1"><FONT class="ft1">November 2008</FONT></P>
<P class="p2"><FONT class="ft1">Introduction</FONT></P>
<P class="p3"><FONT class="ft2">Google welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation. We applaud the Communication's emphasis on the "knowledge economy". This is a very appropriate evolution from the "information society", which informed debate about the Directive's transposition of the 1996 WIPO Internet Treaties. Copyright rules must evolve as the technologies that are used to create and distribute them evolve.</FONT></P>
<P class="p4"><FONT class="ft3">What was not known at that time - although many predictions existed - was the far broader economic and societal changes that the Internet would usher in. Today, the EU is looking to implement a new "Fifth Freedom" for knowledge; new innovation mechanisms based on mass collaboration are reaching macro-economic scale; and a wave of user creativity and free expression have been heralded, for example, under the banner of Web 2.0. Moreover, the Internet has emerged hand in hand with the phenomenon of globalisation: in the knowledge economy, Europe needs to innovate continuously if it is to stay ahead of competitors in this global environment.</FONT></P>
<P class="p5"><FONT class="ft4">Copyright policy is central to this challenge. It is no surprise that the issue that emerges throughout is the balance between incentives for initial creation and those for follow-on innovation. In other words, the central issue for IP policy throughout the ages.</FONT></P>
<P class="p6"><FONT class="ft2">Against this backdrop, the limited scope of the Commission's Green Paper is a disappointment. Google believes that it should be further expanded to address some of the main challenges Europe is facing.

<P class="p10"><FONT class="ft1">I. The value of copyright exceptions in the knowledge economy.</FONT></P>
<P class="p11"><FONT class="ft5">The Green Paper refers to Directive 2001/29/EC pointing at the fact that &#8220;a high level of copyright protection is crucial for intellectual creation&#8221;, since &#8220;a rigorous and effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights&#8221; is necessary to reward and encourage investment in creative efforts. It presents exceptions to copyright law as a way to balance reward for past creation with future dissemination of knowledge.</FONT></P>
<P class="p12"><FONT class="ft2">It is important to consider that while appropriate level of copyright protection can stimulate investment and production of content, thoughtful exceptions are equally essential to the Knowledge Economy by permitting technological development and ensuring that access to knowledge fuels production of more knowledge. The need to encourage new works has to be put in perspective with the importance of exceptions to provide the appropriate conditions for creation, innovation, access to knowledge and the development of the information society, all supporting European competitiveness and growth.</FONT></P>
<P class="p13"><FONT class="ft2">The debate is, therefore, whether the existing balance remains appropriate in the present day, and whether the Directive as a whole will be a reliable contributor to Europe's innovation capacity and competitiveness going forward. This raises issues about the scope of the existing exceptions, and the appropriateness of adding additional exceptions. In addition, it is crucial for the exception regime to be flexible and forward- looking, so as to anticipate and facilitate changes. Failing to do so will put Europe at a competitive disadvantage with countries providing for such flexibility such as the U.S. with the application of the fair use doctrine.</FONT></P>
<P class="p13"><FONT class="ft2">The 2006 Gowers review of Intellectual Property</FONT><FONT class="ft6">1 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">reflected on the need for a greater balance and flexibility of copyright to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use information and ideas in ways consistent with the digital age. As a follow up, the UK IP office launched a public consultation on &#8220;Taking forward the Gowers Review of Intellectual property&#8221; </FONT><FONT class="ft6">2 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">proposing changes to the copyright exceptions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p12"><FONT class="ft7">Four fundamental developments in society and the economy linked to the Internet need to be factored into this reconsideration of the balance between exclusive rights and exceptions:</FONT></P>
<P class="p14"><FONT class="ft3">-</FONT><FONT class="ft8">Global reach of content and knowledge</FONT><FONT class="ft2">: ICTs vastly extend the ability for people around the world, including developing countries, to build upon the bank of existing human knowledge. Although this is a global phenomenon, the single market is a good place to start analysing the impact for EU players.</FONT></P>

<P class="p19"><FONT class="ft2">information online, and for users to find and access information that is relevant to them. (One specific consequence of this is that while the need to bring analogue content online by digitising it has long existed, but the benefits of such a process are now far higher as we have the tools to search through such content).</FONT></P>
<P class="p20"><FONT class="ft3">-</FONT><FONT class="ft12">Users' empowerment with regard to content selection and creation</FONT><FONT class="ft2">: Technological change results in a major shift in audience habit, from passive media consumption to active content selection and creation. As pointed out by the Green Paper, the rise of user- created content has taken major proportions in recent years creating opportunities for a more participative Information Society, and an enormous potential for creativity and new content.</FONT></P>
<P class="p21"><FONT class="ft3">-</FONT><FONT class="ft13">Users are increasingly co-creating value: </FONT><FONT class="ft2">In addition to users creating content, there is also increasing "mass collaboration" by individuals in other areas and resulting in substantial economic value.</FONT></P>
<P class="p22"><FONT class="ft2">With the new opportunities arising from the ways content is accessed and distributed there is a need to rethink the European legal framework for copyright exceptions. It is important not to construe the protection of copyright and promotion of copyright exceptions as contradictory objectives, or the interests of sectors relying on exceptions as opposed to the interest of sectors relying on protection. On the contrary, these are complementary objectives and interests that are both fostering the development of knowledge and creation and their dissemination. In this context, European copyright exception regime has to be reviewed to support:</FONT></P>
<P class="p23"><FONT class="ft14">&#8226;</FONT><FONT class="ft15">The creation of a single market for Information society </FONT><FONT class="ft7">ensuring free movement of information.</FONT></P>

<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft17">1. Free movement of information and the need to create a single market for Knowledge Society.</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft5">The Green Paper recalls the need to promote free movement of knowledge and innovation as the "Fifth Freedom" in the single market, referring to the 2007 Communication on &#8220;A single market for 21st century Europe&#8221;</FONT><FONT class="ft18">3</FONT><FONT class="ft5">. This Communication pointed at the fact that the &#8220;single market originally conceived for an economy reliant on primary products and manufactured goods has to adapt to foster openness and integration in a knowledge-based, service-oriented economy.&#8221; It subsequently highlighted the fact that with the rapid development of ICT, &#8220;there is the risk that Member States opt for</FONT></P>

<P class="p29"><FONT class="ft2">The Commission Communication built on an earlier vision for the single market for the 21st century</FONT><FONT class="ft6">4 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">calling for a single market for the knowledge society. In this context the Commission pointed at the fact that &#8220;[i]mproving the cost-effectiveness, quality and legal certainty of the system of intellectual property rights and spreading the use of new information and communication technologies on a pan-European basis will be essential to tap our research and innovation potential.&#8221; It subsequently called on a &#8220;regulatory framework that will need to be administratively light, flexible and forward-looking, so as to anticipate and facilitate change.&#8221;</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft2">Google considers that the key objectives identified by the Commission for the development of intellectual property rights perfectly reflect on the challenges to be addressed while reviewing the European regime for copyright exceptions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p31"><FONT class="ft2">However, there is no single market for information society services relying on copyright exceptions, unless the exceptions (and their interpretation) are harmonised. Likewise, there is no free movement of information if content, built upon protected content for the purpose of information, education, parody or criticism, is not protected across the EU. Harmonized exceptions across Europe, providing the level of legal certainty needed to distribute content or deploy services relying on copyright exceptions on a Pan-European basis are essential.</FONT></P>
<P class="p32"><FONT class="ft1">2. Innovation, creation and economic growth of the sectors relying on exceptions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p33"><FONT class="ft2">The tension between incentives for initial creation and those for follow-on innovation have long been understood by economists. In granting exclusive rights, policy makers need always to keep in mind the inevitable economic consequences of the monopolies they create - restricted output and higher prices. The Green Paper identifies this economic consequence for orphan works, but appears to have missed its general applicability.</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft2">The extent of the economy now based on follow-on innovation has grown substantially. We have seen the dramatic emergence of new value creation mechanisms based on a very different approach to intellectual property rules. The impact of these is most obvious in the software industry, but examples of have been documented far more broadly in the economy</FONT><FONT class="ft6">5</FONT><FONT class="ft2">. An IP regime that fails to balance these interests will now be a drag on innovation, jobs and growth.</FONT></P>

<P class="p36"><FONT class="ft4">The Green paper rightly points at the economic importance of the European Publishing sector, highlighting its importance in terms of revenues and employment. The figures for the creative industry as a whole are even more impressive. However, no measure of the size of the industry dependent on copyright exceptions and limitations is provided.</FONT></P>
<P class="p37"><FONT class="ft2">Regrettably, there appears to be no European research in this field. However, a 2007 study analysed the economic contribution of industries relying on fair use</FONT><FONT class="ft6">6</FONT><FONT class="ft2">. The US Fair Use doctrine has underpinned enormous innovation in the US, so the figures calculated probably overstate the situation in Europe. Instead, they could be used to estimate the beneficial impact of copyright reform.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft5">The study demonstrated that exceptions to copyright protection promote innovation and are a major catalyst of economic growth. It pointed at the fact that copyright limitations and exceptions are vital to many industries and stimulate growth across the economy. According to this study, companies benefiting from fair use generate substantial revenue, employ millions of workers, and, in 2006, represented one-sixth of total U.S. GDP. In 2006, fair use industries generated revenue of $4.5 trillion. As for the sector benefiting from fair use the study notably points at manufacturers of consumer devices that allow individual copying of copyrighted programming, educational institutions, software developers, as well as Internet search and web hosting providers.</FONT></P>
<P class="p38"><FONT class="ft17">3. Promotion of users&#8217; fundamental rights and notably freedom of expression and access to information.</FONT></P>
<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft2">Copyright exceptions also seek to balance copyright protection with users&#8217; fundamental rights, and notably Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) that provides for a &#8220;right to freedom of expression&#8221;. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas. Exceptions for quotations, parody, or public speeches have been central parts of most member states' copyright regimes.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft5">The Internet revolution is profoundly changing the notion of free expression. ICT is enabling a revolution in the ability for users to create and edit content. The Internet then empowers them to share their views and work around the world. The exercise of freedom of expression is no longer limited to professional journalists or mainstream media. It is increasingly exercised by individual users through blogs, podcast or posting of videos, making reuse of existing content for the purpose of education, information, parody or criticism. Bloggers quoting press articles may nowadays be more influential and have a bigger audience than renowned journalists</FONT><FONT class="ft18">7</FONT><FONT class="ft5">. User created videos making parody of politics, or showing music lovers how to play a well-known tune, can be viewed millions times. Critics or review of content from users' communities can have more impact than critics in newspaper. In this context the implementation of strictly defined copyright</FONT></P>

<P class="p42"><FONT class="ft5">With the exponential amount of information made available online, the ability of citizens to search publicly available information that is relevant for them, is an integral part of their freedom of expression. Some academics argue that Article 10 of the ECHR should be interpreted in the light of its precursor Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes &#8216;freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds&#8221;, itself echoing Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: &#8220;freedom to &#8230; seek, receive and impart information and ideas&#8230;&#8221;</FONT><FONT class="ft18">8</FONT><FONT class="ft5">.</FONT></P>
<P class="p32"><FONT class="ft1">II. Shortcomings of the European regime for copyright exceptions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p43"><FONT class="ft5">The 2001/29/EC Directive was meant to implement the 1996 WIPO Internet treaties, and harmonise copyright protection at European level. As for copyright exceptions it points at the &#8220;direct negative effect on the functioning of the internal market of copyright and related rights&#8221; of the lack of harmonisation of copyright exceptions as an issue. However it only proposed to address it through an exhaustive list of strictly defined exceptions, leaving the possibility for Member States to implement any of the listed exceptions in national legislation, but no further restriction to the exclusive rights. Apart from the exception for transient copy (Article 5.1) which is central for the development of the information society and made mandatory, the other exceptions are optional and have not been conceived taking any particular consideration for the new content creation and dissemination opportunities arising in a dynamic information market.</FONT></P>
<P class="p44"><FONT class="ft3">This approach raises concerns with regard to:</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft14">&#8226;</FONT><FONT class="ft21">The lack of harmonisation and legal uncertainty </FONT><FONT class="ft2">resulting from very different implementations of the optional list of limitations by Member States.</FONT></P>
<P class="p46"><FONT class="ft14">&#8226;</FONT><FONT class="ft21">The lack of flexibility </FONT><FONT class="ft2">of an exhaustive list of exceptions to take account of technological developments and foster innovation.</FONT></P>
<P class="p46"><FONT class="ft14">&#8226;</FONT><FONT class="ft15">The need for lengthy legislative change </FONT><FONT class="ft7">at both European and national level to allow for new exceptions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p47"><FONT class="ft1">1. Lack of harmonisation of the European exception regime.</FONT></P>
<P class="p43"><FONT class="ft4">The lack of harmonisation results from very different implementations of the long list of optional exceptions provided by Directive 2001/29/EC.

This gives rise to a wide variety of rules applicable to services distributed across the Internal Market, and to diverging case law in Member States on similar services. The resulting complexity and legal uncertainty constitutes an impediment to the development of innovative online services across Europe, and in certain cases prevent innovative and creative companies to reap the benefits from the Internal Market.</FONT></P>
<P class="p50"><FONT class="ft4">The IViR study on &#8220;The Recasting of Copyright & Related Rights for the Knowledge Economy&#8221; commissioned to assess the implementation of the Directive clearly pointed at the lack of harmonisation of the European regime for copyright exception and limitation, and its negative impact, and proposed concrete measures to address this problem</FONT><FONT class="ft22">9</FONT><FONT class="ft4">.</FONT></P>
<P class="p51"><FONT class="ft5">Commenting on the implementation and effect of the non-mandatory list of exceptions proposed by Directive 2001/29/EC, The study on "Conceiving an International instrument on limitations and exceptions to copyright"</FONT><FONT class="ft18">10 </FONT><FONT class="ft5">states that: "[It] has left Europe with a patchwork of incompatible limitations and exceptions, causing legal uncertainty to the detriment of commercial providers of cross-border services, such as online music stores, and of cultural institutions, such as libraries, archives and public broadcasters, offering content across European borders. Directive 2001/29/EC</FONT><FONT class="ft18">11 </FONT><FONT class="ft5">itself highlighted the need for &#8220;a coherent application of these exceptions and limitations, [to] be assessed when reviewing implementing legislation in the future.&#8221;</FONT></P>
<P class="p52"><FONT class="ft1">2. Lack of flexibility to take account and adapt to technological developments.</FONT></P>
<P class="p53"><FONT class="ft4">A long list of strictly limited and applied exceptions does not provide for timely solutions to the challenges and opportunities arising in a dynamic information market. This hinders the emergence of innovative services and business models, the uptake of user-created content or digital preservation and exploitation of European cultural heritage.</FONT></P>
<P class="p54"><FONT class="ft2">This lack of flexibility of the European regime for copyright exception and limitation has also been identified in the IViR Study</FONT><FONT class="ft6">12</FONT><FONT class="ft2">. It notably called upon the EC legislature &#8220;to establish a more flexible and forward looking regime of limitations on copyright and related rights&#8221;, considering that &#8220;a non-exhaustive list of limitations would allow Member States to respond more quickly than the EC legislature to urgent situations that will arise in the dynamic information market&#8221;.</FONT></P>
<P class="p50"><FONT class="ft5">Google support this analysis, considering that the existing exceptions do not provide sufficient flexibility to adapt to the evolving needs of individuals, businesses and institutions. There is a need to put such recommendations into concrete form by providing for a flexible regime of exceptions, allowing uses that are outside the scope of strictly defined exceptions, but within the three-step test. This should address the current</FONT></P>

<P class="p56"><FONT class="ft17">III. Solutions to ensure that the European exception regime meets the challenge of the knowledge society.</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft3">The key objectives when reviewing the European copyright exception regime should be to ensure through harmonised exceptions that the public can fully utilise new tools provided by ICT to create new works and access knowledge; to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is furthered and not impaired. This requires Commission attention to the impact on the single market of differing national choices of exceptions; work on transitory measures to improve the understanding of the three step test to ensure that exceptions have broadly similar impact at national level and are interpreted with sufficient permissiveness to promote innovation; and analysis by the Commission on the economic impact of copyright protection and exception on follow-on innovation and on the free movement on knowledge and on online freedom of expression to support reform of the Directive.</FONT></P>
<P class="p58"><FONT class="ft17">1. Transitory measures to improve harmonisation and flexibility of the exception regime.</FONT></P>
<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft3">The Green Paper points at the fact that &#8220;[T]he three-step test is [&#8230;] part of the international copyright framework which the Community and its Member States are bound to respect [&#8230;] and has become a benchmark for all copyright limitations.&#8221; As for Article 5 (5) of Directive 2001/29/EC, Member States were not required to implement the test into their national copyright laws. As a result the status of the three-step-test, as envisaged under Article 5 (5), varies considerably as between Member States. In academic writing the test is perceived as a matter of legislative compliance with international prerequisites rather than a rule of interpretation of domestic law, and it is unresolved whether the test only constitutes a guideline for legislative action or for interpretation of exceptions by national judges</FONT><FONT class="ft26">13</FONT><FONT class="ft3">. In addition the three step test is not necessarily applied in a consistent way by national judges, raising additional uncertainties as for the distribution of content or services relying on copyright exception across the single market.</FONT></P>
<P class="p59"><FONT class="ft2">Further analysis</FONT><FONT class="ft6">14 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">on the three-steps test also points at the fact that &#8220;[t]he evolution of the three-step test into the overriding norm of international copyright law through its incorporation into the TRIPS Agreement, has attracted criticism from scholars and stakeholders alike. [&#8230;] Its focus, as with the entire structure of minimum rights, is geared towards protecting rights of authors or, in the case of TRIPS, &#8220;right holders,&#8221; not the interests of society or the general public.&#8221;</FONT></P>

<P class="p61"><FONT class="ft2">In order to provide flexibility to the European copyright exception regime, and ensure a balanced and consistent application of the three step test across the single market, the European Commission should issue guiding principles on its application by Member States and national judges when appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft5">A recent declaration from some of the most renowned European academics in the field of copyright on &#8220;A balanced interpretation of the &#8220;three-step test&#8221; in copyright law&#8221;</FONT><FONT class="ft18">15 </FONT><FONT class="ft5">provides clear basis for developing such guidance. The declaration rightly identifies that: &#8220;The Three-Step Test has already established an effective means of preventing the excessive application of limitations and exceptions. However, there is no complementary mechanism prohibiting an unduly narrow or restrictive approach. For this reason, the Three-Step Test should be interpreted so as to ensure a proper and balanced application of limitations and exceptions.&#8221; The Declaration further established a set of basic guiding principles on the interpretation of the three step test.</FONT></P>
<P class="p62"><FONT class="ft2">Google supports the general approach established by this declaration in Europe, and believes that the issuance by the European Commission of guiding principles on the three step tests will ensure its balanced and consistent application across the single market, and partially address the lack of flexibility of the European exception regime to meet the challenges of the knowledge society.</FONT></P>
<P class="p47"><FONT class="ft1">2. Review of the European exception regime.</FONT></P>
<P class="p63"><FONT class="ft2">While a new approach of the three steps test could buy the EU some time in order to remain competitive with third countries, Google believes that only a full review of the 2001/29/EC Directive to introduce new exceptions will ultimately serve the purpose of providing flexible and forward thinking regime allowing free movement of knowledge, innovation and creation in the sectors relying on exceptions, as well as new ways freedom of expression is exercised in the information society.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft2">As explained (See p. 3), the development of the participative web and the uptake of user- created content constitute formidable drivers for users' self-expression, creativity and access to knowledge. The development of the information society leads to users&#8217; empowerment for creation and distribution of content. At the same time, there is a need to adapt the existing exception regime to the opportunities offered by the development of the information society and ensure that it provides for the level of flexibility needed for innovative online services to develop across Europe.</FONT></P>
<P class="p64"><FONT class="ft2">In this context, Google supports the introduction of new exceptions to foster users' creativity and online accessibility to knowledge and content, and calls on the European Commission to actively engage in developing and implementing such exceptions in a way that best promote users' creativity and accessibility while preserving the interest of rightholders.</FONT></P>

The list of exceptions and limitations established a set of cases in which the exclusive rights of right holders to authorize or prohibit the reproduction or communication to the public of their works do not apply. Contracts are therefore only needed for uses that go beyond these baseline exceptions. For these situations, however, encouragement and guidelines to facilitate efficient contracting may be helpful.</FONT></P>
<P class="p70"><FONT class="ft1">(3) Is an approach based on a list of non-mandatory exceptions adequate in the light of evolving Internet technologies and the prevalent economic and social expectations?</FONT></P>
<P class="p71"><FONT class="ft2">In order for harmonisation to be effective and to serve a single market, there must be a core of mandatory exceptions, coupled with a flexible regime permitting courts to adapt to evolving circumstances. As explained in the introductory remarks, Internet technologies allow a global reach for services and content relying on copyright exceptions. In this context, the optional or non-mandatory nature of the exceptions listed in Directive 2001/29/EC has led to different sets of copyright exceptions being implemented in the different Member States. This constitutes an impediment to the distribution of services or content relying on exceptions, and an obstacle to the creation of a single market for the knowledge economy.</FONT></P>
<P class="p72"><FONT class="ft5">But the optional nature of the exceptions is not the only obstacle. The diverging implementations of the same exception or of the application of the three step test, from one Member State to the other may also be a major obstacle. Hence, there is a need to provide for mandatory exceptions, as well as guidelines on the way they should be implemented at national level and how the three step test should be applied.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft4">In addition, the major challenge for the European copyright exception regime to be addressed in the light of evolving Internet technologies, is the lack of flexibility of an exhaustive list of exception. This approach lacks the flexibility needed to provide timely solutions for the development of innovative services or new creative processes.</FONT></P>
<P class="p73"><FONT class="ft29">(4) Should certain categories of exceptions be made mandatory to ensure more legal certainty and better protection of beneficiaries of exceptions? If so, which ones?</FONT></P>

<P class="p74"><FONT class="ft4">The development of the information society has been made possible by the mandatory exception for caching that is central to the functioning of the Internet. In order to provide the level of harmonisation needed for content or services relying on copyright exceptions in the single market, an approach based on non-mandatory exceptions is not appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P class="p75"><FONT class="ft1">Exceptions for libraries and archives</FONT></P>
<P class="p76"><FONT class="ft5">Google firmly believes that digitisation, digital preservation and online accessibility of literary works in Europe is an important objective with far reaching and long term benefits for society. Taking into account the complexity and cost associated with digital preservation, this objective can only be fulfilled with the positive engagement of various parties, including, libraries, right holders and private companies. Google&#8217;s view is that the copyright framework should provide incentives to the different partners to digitise by reducing legal complexity and costs. Failing to do so, will not permit to digitally preserve and revive our knowledge and cultural heritage through online availability.</FONT></P>
<P class="p77"><FONT class="ft5">As already mentioned the problem of a list of strictly defined exceptions established by Directive 2001/29/EC lacks the flexibility needed to fully reap the benefits that the development of the information society is bringing about. As illustrated by the 2006 Commission Recommendation on the &#8220;Digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation&#8221;</FONT><FONT class="ft18">16</FONT><FONT class="ft5">, ensuring that public institutions can fulfill their role of preservation in the digital age, by having the faculty of making multiple copying or to migrate digital cultural material, requests legislative changes in different Member States. However, this is a lengthy and complicated process that is delaying or even preventing public institutions to fulfill their mission of digital preservation.</FONT></P>
<P class="p78"><FONT class="ft29">(6) Should the exception for libraries and archives remain unchanged because publishers themselves will develop online access to their catalogues?</FONT></P>
<P class="p79"><FONT class="ft2">No. While it is crucial for publishers to develop online access to their catalogues, this objective differs both in scope and in nature with the objective of libraries and archives. The challenge face by libraries or archives is to digitally preserve and make available their collections of books for the benefits of users and public interest. This calls for adaptation of the exception for libraries to make sure that they can address these challenges in the digital age.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft5">The challenge faced by publishers is to develop online access to their catalogue to fully benefit from market opportunities the development of the information society is bringing about to increase visibility and availability of their products. Google is fully supporting this effort with Google Book Search, and has developed partnerships with more than 20.000 publishers around the world, through its Book Search Partner Programme. Partners (typically publishers) are providing Google their books to digitise and put online. Users are then shown a strictly limited number of book pages that are relevant to their</FONT></P>

<P class="p82"><FONT class="ft1">(7) In order to increase access to works, should publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives enter into licensing schemes with the publishers? Are there examples of successful licensing schemes for online access to library collections?</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft3">As pointed out in the answer to question 6, the challenge for libraries or archives is to digitally preserve and make their collections of books available for the benefits of users and public interest. Google is also contributing to the effort of libraries to preserve and improve access to their collections through the Library Project. Libraries across the world have joined Google Book Search as partners, working with us to digitise their books. This means that publications previously only accessible to people searching in those libraries are now searchable on the Internet. If the book is in the public domain it is shown in its entirety, and users can download a PDF of the text. If a book in the Library Project is still in copyright, users can see only two or three short snippets which include the search term, some bibliographic information, and other reference information designed to help the user.</FONT></P>
<P class="p83"><FONT class="ft2">The fair use exception provided the legal basis for Google to engage in the scanning of in-copyright books in the U.S. to make them searchable, and to display snippets for users to assess if a specific book is relevant for them.</FONT></P>
<P class="p84"><FONT class="ft2">With the view to further increased users&#8217; access to books in the United States, a broad class of authors and publishers and Google reached in October 2008 an agreement to dramatically increase online access to books in the U.S. If approved by the Court, the agreement, reached after more than two years of negotiations, would resolve both U.S. lawsuits and will be a major step forward in improving online access for books in the U.S. It will notably provide for increased access to out-of-print books, and a solution to allow for the online availability of orphan works</FONT><FONT class="ft6">17</FONT><FONT class="ft2">.</FONT></P>
<P class="p85"><FONT class="ft30">(8) Should the scope of the exception for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives be clarified with respect to: (a) Format shifting; (b) The number of copies that can be made under the exception; (c) The scanning of entire collections held by libraries;</FONT></P>
<P class="p25"><FONT class="ft5">Yes. Digitising works is essential to preserve them; copies can be lost, damaged, or too fragile to permit access to the pubic at large. The risk to loose works fully justifies the extension of the exception to any act needed to ensure their digital preservation. In this context, and with the view to develop a future-proof approach there do not seem to have any reason to limit the number of copies or restrict the acts of format shift needed to preserve digital copies of protected works realised for preservation purpose. In addition, the scope of the exception should be clarified to make clear that it applies to any type of</FONT></P>

<P class="p86"><FONT class="ft7">work since different countries have implemented the exceptions by restricting it to certain types of works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p87"><FONT class="ft2">Finally, taking into account the technical complexity and cost involve to ensure digital preservation, the exception for publicly accessible library should provide for the flexibility needed to allow for libraries to partner with private companies to realise copies of work for preservation purposes.</FONT></P>
<P class="p88"><FONT class="ft1">(9) Should the law be clarified with respect to whether the scanning of works held in libraries for the purpose of making their content searchable on the Internet goes beyond the scope of current exceptions to copyright?</FONT></P>
<P class="p89"><FONT class="ft2">This question suggests that the exception should only be clarified in a more restrictive way. By doing so, it disregards the possibility to clarify that the reproduction of content for the only purpose of making it searchable, actually falls under the scope of the exception.</FONT></P>
<P class="p90"><FONT class="ft2">One of the foundations of the success of the Internet is the network effect that occurs when information is put online. In this context there is a clear benefit for users, researchers, but also rightholders to ensure that works are made searchable through digitisation. While users benefits from increased accessibility to content and knowledge, rightholders benefit from increased visibility of their works, which offers new opportunities for exploitation and revenues.</FONT></P>
<P class="p91"><FONT class="ft2">Google would support such a clarification that would provide an incentive for private partners to engage with libraries in the digitisation of their collections for the purpose of making them searchable. This would in no case prevent agreements with publishers to digitise their books, to allow for users searching their works to have online access to a substantial part of it and assess if it is relevant for them, before paying to access the full content of the book.</FONT></P>
<P class="p87"><FONT class="ft7">As explained above Google has already developed partnerships with more than 20.000 publishers, which recognize the added value of ensuring that their books are searchable, but also that their users can easily assess if they are relevant for them.</FONT></P>
<P class="p92"><FONT class="ft1">(10) Is a further Community statutory instrument required to deal with the problem of orphan works, which goes beyond the Commission Recommendation 2006/585/EC of 24 August 2006?</FONT></P>
<P class="p93"><FONT class="ft5">Yes. Orphan works represent an untapped wealth of information that can and should be accessible to the public. It is among the most acute problems preventing public and private actors to preserve and revive an important part of our knowledge and cultural heritage</FONT><FONT class="ft18">18</FONT><FONT class="ft5">. According to the Gowers review: &#8220;Across the spectrum of the creative industries, there is recognition that solving the problem of orphan works is good for everyone. A solution is good for all those who are involved in archiving and cataloguing;</FONT></P>

<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft2">Given the large number of orphan works, Google believes that unless a legislative solution is put in place there is no sufficient incentive to digitise or engage in good faith searches. In most cases, conducting searches to identify right holders is costly and time consuming and the risk of liability for copyright infringement sufficient to deter stakeholders from exploiting orphan works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft2">Google considers that this is a case of market failure that justifies a Community statutory instrument to provide for the level of legal security and incentive needed to engage in large scale digitisation in Europe. The Gowers review proposed a new copyright exception to &#8220;permit the use of genuine orphan works, provided the user has performed a reasonable search and, where possible, gives attribution&#8221;, and called for amending Directive 2001/29/EC in that way.</FONT></P>
<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft3">Google supports the proposition for such a new exception to allow the exploitation of orphan works under conditions preserving the interest of right holders. Such an exception should apply to situation where after a reasonably diligent search, the right holder cannot be identified or located. The implementation of such a new exception should strike the right balance in providing the incentive needed for the exploitation of orphan works, while preserving rightholders' interests. It should also be coupled with voluntary copyright registration systems to facilitate the identification of rights holders for both existing and future works. The purposes of such system will be to facilitate diligent search, reduce the number of orphan works and simplify and lower the cost of copyright clearance.</FONT></P>
<P class="p94"><FONT class="ft30">(11 & 12) If so, should this be done by amending the 2001 Directive on Copyright in the information society or through a stand-alone instrument? - How should the cross-border aspects of the orphan works issue be tackled to ensure EU-wide recognition of the solutions adopted in different Member States?</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft7">Taking into account the need to provide for a new exception to copyright, and the implementation of solutions applicable at European level, the problem of orphan works should be addressed through an amendment to Directive 2001/29/EC.</FONT></P>
<P class="p95"><FONT class="ft1">Exception for the benefit of people with a disability</FONT></P>
<P class="p96"><FONT class="ft2">As for the questions related to people with disability Google does not have any detailed position on the issue, but believes that exceptions designed to balance protection with public interest should fully benefit to improving access to content to people with disability notably through the use of new technologies.</FONT></P>

<P class="p98"><FONT class="ft5">Exception for education and research should also be adapted to allow for students and researcher to fully benefits from the opportunities the Internet is offering in possibilities to share educational or research material. The Center for Social Media report on the &#8220;Cost of copyright confusion for media literacy&#8221;</FONT><FONT class="ft18">20 </FONT><FONT class="ft5">demonstrates that in the U.S. many teachers refrain from using copyright protected material, since they fear that they will misinterpret copyright exception. Copyright exceptions should be defined in a way providing teachers with the legal certainty and latitude needed to develop the most effective teaching materials, and to take advantage of new communications technologies.</FONT></P>
<P class="p99"><FONT class="ft3">Article 5.3 (a) should reflect on the potential of the Internet to provide for new forms of educational material, and for the educational institutions to make their material widely available online to any person that could benefit from accessing it. In addition new communication technologies makes it possible to use any type of material for educational and research purposes (text, but also video or pictures). National implementation of Article 5.3 (a), should not restrict the exception to certain institutions or class of content. They should only be limited to the intended purposes of the use of the content, i.e. non- commercial educational purposes.</FONT></P>

<P class="p102"><FONT class="ft2">Rules on what end users can and cannot do when making use of materials protected by copyright should encourage transformative conduct by the public through a flexible regime. As pointed out in the introductory remarks (See p. 7) such flexibility is needed to allow for creative and innovative developments to take place in Europe.</FONT></P>
<P class="p7"><FONT class="ft1">(25) Should an exception for user-created content be introduced into the Directive?</FONT></P>
<P class="p98"><FONT class="ft4">Yes. Such an exception should be included as part of a cohesive scheme of exceptions. The development of the participative web and the uptake of user-created content constitute formidable drivers for users' self-expression, creativity and access to knowledge.
