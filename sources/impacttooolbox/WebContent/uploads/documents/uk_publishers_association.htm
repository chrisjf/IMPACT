<P class="p17"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft10">We welcome any encouragement for contractual arrangements between rightsholders and users for the implementation of copyright exceptions, but we urge the Commission to avoid any prescriptive regulation or guidelines in this area.</FONT></P>

<P class="p16"><FONT class="ft1">Introduction</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft13">The Publishers Association</FONT></P>
<P class="p28"><FONT class="ft14">The UK Publishers Association (the PA) is the leading trade body representing consumer trade, academic and educational publishers in the UK. The UK publishing industry is one of the largest in the EU, and our members represent approximately &#163;4 billion of the &#163;5 billion UK turnover in these sectors. According to a recent survey conducted by the Federation of European Publishers (the FEP), the EU publishing sector employs 123,000 full-time employees and the annual sales revenue of book publishers within the EU and the EEA is approximately &#8364;22 billion.</FONT></P>
<P class="p29"><FONT class="ft14">We welcome the opportunity to comment on the Commission&#8217;s work in this crucial area for the creative industries. We also support and endorse the submission of the FEP, to which we have contributed.</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft13">Copyright in the UK Knowledge Economy</FONT></P>
<P class="p31"><FONT class="ft14">The UK knowledge economy was estimated by the recent Gowers Review (</FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.hm- treasury.gov.uk/gowers_review_index.htm</FONT><FONT class="ft14">) as constituting 7.3% of the total UK Gross Domestic Product. Publishing is a significant part of this sector. The creative industries represent a significant growth opportunity for the UK economy, as outlined by the UK Government in its </FONT><FONT class="ft16">Creative Britain </FONT><FONT class="ft14">strategy, which was published in February 2008 (</FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/3572.aspx</FONT><FONT class="ft14">) and the effective management and exploitation of IP rights in digital content will be an essential element of any such strategy. Technologies such as Automated Content Access Protocol (ACAP) (</FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.the-acap.org</FONT><FONT class="ft14">) that can communicate such rights in machine-readable form to web crawlers, and around which fresh business models will be built, need support and encouragement within the regulatory framework.</FONT></P>
<P class="p32"><FONT class="ft14">None of this growth has come about by accident or without considerable energy and investment by creators and the creative industries over recent years. Intellectual property, and copyright in particular, is the essential legal underpinning for this investment and, indeed, for the entire publishing industry: apart from neighbouring rights, such as database rights, it is virtually the only specific legal protection to which publishers have recourse. This means that protection and enforcement of IP rights is inevitably crucial for us, particularly in a digital age which facilitates easy copying and dissemination. The Gowers Review acknowledged this at the outset of its report (paragraph 1.4):</FONT></P>
<P class="p33"><FONT class="ft14">&#8220;Ideas are expensive to produce but cheap to copy. The fixed costs of producing knowledge are high&#8230; Without protection, o thers will free ride on the creator&#8217;s initial investment and sell the invention or creation at much lower cost. If the innovator knows that someone else can do this easily, there will be no financial incentive to innovate in the first place.&#8221;</FONT></P>
<P class="p34"><FONT class="ft14">The EU Commission itself acknowledged the importance of copyright in the Information Society Directive of 2001 (recital 9):</FONT></P>
<P class="p35"><FONT class="ft14">&#8220;Any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation. Their protection helps to ensure the maintenance and development of creativity in the</FONT></P>

<DIV id="page_4">

<P class="p37"><FONT class="ft14">interests of authors, performers, producers, consumers, culture, industry and the public at large.&#8221;</FONT></P>
<P class="p38"><FONT class="ft14">For the same reason, copyright exceptions are equally of concern to publishers, if they have the potential to weaken or lessen the protection for published works. It is essential in the digital age that they should be designed to be balanced in the interests of consumers and society without jeopardising the underlying legal protection for the published works themselves and without opening dangerous or unintended loopholes which may be unfairly exploited. An increasingly important test for balance in copyright exceptions is contained in the Berne Convention three-step test, reproduced verbatim in the Information Society Directive (Article 5.5), which affirms that exceptions should be limited to 1) certain special cases, which 2) do not conflict with normal exploitation of the work, and which 3) do not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the rights holder. In the digital environment, this test is becoming an essential yardstick.</FONT></P>
<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft14">The role of publishers, through investments made at their own risk, is to deliver maximum access to the IP works that they bring to market. Nevertheless, publishers are not averse to the development of appropriate and controlled copyright exceptions to adapt to changing needs and circumstances. It is important to bear in mind that publishers are users too, of each others&#8217; products, with permission (for example, in anthologies), and so need to use copyright exceptions themselves in appropriate circumstances. Publishers are also very aware of their own users&#8217; needs for easy, cost-effective access to the works they publish, and are constantly looking to develop improved licensing solutions to complement and enhance the limited access rights already given by copyright exceptions. The publishing industry is not about &#8216;locking up&#8217; content. Publishers are here to publish: this is what we do.</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft17">In our view any workable and fair copyright system must depend on a reasonable balance between rights and exceptions. In the UK&#8217;s case, this balance has been at the root of copyright protection since the UK&#8217;s first Copyright Act of 1709, and has survived intact through 300 years of rapid social and technological change, not as an historical legacy but because balance is vital for the system to work, and this need still pertains today. The EU&#8217;s Charter of Fundamental Rights of 2000 illustrates the same need for balance, in protecting both freedom of information (Article 11) and the right to property (expressly including IP) (Article 17). Clearly both cannot be protected effectively without achieving a balance between the two. In another example, the Green Paper cites the Commission&#8217;s review of the Single Market, </FONT><FONT class="ft18">A Single Market for 21st Century Europe</FONT><FONT class="ft17">, of November 2007 as &#8220;highlighting the need to promote free</FONT></P>
<P class="p40"><FONT class="ft19">th</FONT></P>
<P class="p41"><FONT class="ft14">movement of knowledge and innovation as the &#8216;5 Freedom&#8217; in the single market&#8221;. It neglects to add that, on the same page, protection for IP rights is specifically referred to as well, including enforcement and awareness of IP rights by small and medium enterprises and action plans against counterfeiting and piracy. The necessary balance between free movement of knowledge and protection of IP rights is only achieved when both are acknowledged and discussed together, since both are vitally important to the single market.</FONT></P>
<P class="p42"><FONT class="ft14">These issues have already been addressed, both at EU and UK level. The 2001 EU Information Society Directive went a long way towards preparing the ground for the digital marketplace and, we believe, struck a fair balance between all stakeholders, after seven years of vigorous lobbying on all sides of the debate. In the UK, the recommendations of the Gowers Review achieved, in our opinion, a similar balance.</FONT></P>

<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft5">Page 4 of 37</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_5">

<P class="p44"><FONT class="ft14">We urge the Commission to do all it can to preserve this hard-won balance, so that the copyright protections and exceptions underpinning the knowledge economy may continue to develop as they have so far, in the interests of creators as much as other stakeholders.</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft1">Responses to specific questions</FONT></P>
<P class="p46"><FONT class="ft13">1.</FONT><FONT class="ft20">Should there be encouragement or guidelines for contractual arrangements between rightsholders and users for the implementation of copyright exceptions?</FONT></P>
<P class="p47"><FONT class="ft14">Publishers would welcome any encouragement for such contractual arrangements, which are already widely used in the publishing world, particularly where they offer users a greater or more flexible degree of access than existing copyright exceptions might do on their own. Publishing contracts or licences often have this effect, for the benefit of users. A good recent UK example has been the copyright exception for Visually Impaired People, contained in the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act of 2002.</FONT></P>
<P class="p48"><FONT class="ft14">In fact there were two exceptions, 1) for the benefit of individual visually impaired people, to make &#8216;accessible&#8217; copies themselves, within stated limits, and 2) for the benefit of organisations such as the RNIB (</FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.rnib.org.uk</FONT><FONT class="ft14">) acting collectively to make multiple copies for their members. Two important points should be made with reference to these exceptions. Firstly, the second (collective) exception for multiple copies did not come into effect if, and to the extent that, agreed suitable licensing scheme existed. Two licensing schemes have now come into effect, for literary works (operated by the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA), </FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.cla.co.uk</FONT><FONT class="ft14">) and for musical works (operated by the Music Publishers Association (MPA)). Both schemes give greater access and flexibility for users than the statutory exception does itself. Secondly, rights holders are going even further than this, after continuing discussions with visually impaired (and, more recently, dyslexic) people, and are initiating pilot projects for secure access to publishers&#8217; digital files as close to publication date as possible, covering both trade and educational titles. A pilot which offers a range of 30 newly published trade titles will shortly go live, with the expectation that these titles will be available in selected Waterstones outlets and other retailers from 2009.</FONT></P>
<P class="p49"><FONT class="ft14">Both pilots are being facilitated by the UK Government&#8217;s Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), which has worked effectively to ensure that fair access for all relevant disabled people in the 21</FONT><FONT class="ft21">st </FONT><FONT class="ft14">century should be respected, but not at the expense of the creative industries&#8217; legitimate need for copyright protection. All those involved in these UK discussions feel this is a good example of how stakeholders, facilitated where necessary by government, can better achieve access through effective licensed arrangements than might be possible under copyright exceptions alone.</FONT></P>
<P class="p50"><FONT class="ft14">It is however important to sound a note of caution about &#8216;guidelines&#8217;. In the example above, UK government intervention was helpfully limited to facilitation and validation of existing stakeholder discussions, which led to bilateral agreements in accord with UK government (and EU) policy relating to disabled people. However, prescriptive</FONT></P>

<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft5">Page 5 of 37</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_6">

<P class="p52"><FONT class="ft14">regulations (or, even worse, laws) would be likely to have the opposite effect, and we urge the Commission to avoid any temptation to over-legislate in this area. The only example given in the Green Paper of any alleged need to intervene is that of (unidentified) composers, directors, journalists and performers who, it is claimed, argue that they have not received any revenue from the exercise of the new &#8216;making available&#8217; right.</FONT></P>
<P class="p53"><FONT class="ft14">Whilst we cannot speak for other industries, in the book publishing industry most author contracts provide reasonable remuneration for all exploitation of their works, including online uses and via the &#8216;making available&#8217; right. Revenue attributable to making available might not always be separately identified as such, but it will certainly be included, along with other electronic revenues. Author representative bodies in the UK such as the Society of Authors regularly monitor and inspect publishers&#8217; royalty accounting procedures and, where improvements are necessary, make practical proposals for change. We have no evidence that remuneration for the making available right is an issue for authors in the UK.</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft14">Finally, the UK and EU are already well supplied with effective contract laws, designed to protect consumers against issues such as unfair contracts, and EU competition laws already protect against anti-competitive behaviour or abuse of dominant positions. There is no evidence that interference with either well-established regime is necessary.</FONT></P>
<P class="p54"><FONT class="ft13">2.</FONT><FONT class="ft22">Should there be encouragement, guidelines or model licences for contractual arrangements between rightsholders and users on other aspects not covered by copyright exceptions?</FONT></P>
<P class="p55"><FONT class="ft14">See answer to (1) above for our views on the important distinction between encouragement, which is welcome, and formal guidelines, particularly if the latter are to have legislative force. The points made above will apply with even greater force to areas not covered by copyright exceptions, where there is no proven need to disturb existing EU and national contract and competition laws. Article 9 and Recital 40 of the Information Society Directive 2001 provide for promotion and protection of existing contracts or licences, for the very good reason that in most cases these demonstrably work, and very much in the user&#8217;s interests. As a general rule, we believe that regulatory alternatives to existing contracts and licences should only be contemplated if there is clear evidence of market failure.</FONT></P>
<P class="p56"><FONT class="ft14">Publishers do, of course, provide their own guidelines, for example the PA Code of Practice relating to general contracts between authors and publishers, which is currently under revision in response to changes in the digital environment. Self- regulatory industry guidelines also exist in specific areas such as the needs of visually impaired and disabled people (see Appendix A, which contains the PA&#8217;s publisher guidelines for meeting permissions requests on behalf of reading impaired people). Model licences are effective when negotiated and discussed fully between stakeholders, but model licences drafted or imposed without full consultation would have limited use, and in our view might actively restrictive innovation to a dangerous extent.</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft14">Machine-readable contract and rights information technology which is open-source and interoperable, such as ACAP, is still in the process of development and</FONT></P>

<DIV id="page_7">

<P class="p58"><FONT class="ft14">negotiation between the stakeholders in the online marketplace, but we believe that such technology will rapidly mature and preclude the need for regulatory intervention in contractual arrangements.</FONT></P>
<P class="p59"><FONT class="ft13">3.</FONT><FONT class="ft20">Is an approach based on a list of non-mandatory exceptions adequate in the light of evolving Internet technologies and the prevalent economic and social expectations?</FONT></P>
<P class="p60"><FONT class="ft14">At the time of the 2001 Directive this approach was not necessarily the preferred option for rights holders, and we can understand why in retrospect the end result may appear unwieldy, but after seven years of very vigorous lobbying by all stakeholders it seemed the only effective way to provide the necessary flexibility to cover 1) rapidly evolving technologies, and 2) the experience of different member states&#8217; national laws and cultures. It also has the advantage of lower costs for enforcement and review via member states&#8217; own domestic legislatures and courts. Since the 2001 Directive has only just been fully implemented it is too early to say whether this structure is effective across the expanded EU. However, we are not aware of any objective evidence to date suggesting otherwise.</FONT></P>
<P class="p61"><FONT class="ft23">4.</FONT><FONT class="ft24">Should certain categories of exceptions be made mandatory to ensure more legal certainty and better protection of beneficiaries of exceptions?</FONT></P>
<P class="p62"><FONT class="ft14">Not in our view, no. Article 5.1, the exception for temporary and transient acts of reproduction, is already mandatory, and we believe has been effectively implemented in all member states, but we can find no other examples of exceptions where mandatory force would in any way provide better protection (the limited effect of the visually impaired exception in the UK, described at (1) above, is a good example). There is also the considerable risk that any mandatory exception would have to incorporate generic terms which would inevitably be interpreted differently, or according to different languages and cultures, in different member states.</FONT></P>
<P class="p63"><FONT class="ft13">5. If so, which ones?</FONT></P>
<P class="p62"><FONT class="ft14">See our response to (4), above.</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft13">3.1 Exceptions for libraries and archives</FONT></P>
<P class="p28"><FONT class="ft14">The introductory discussion in this section of the Green Paper raises key issues, helpfully referring to the High Level Expert Group recommendations of 4 June 2008 on digitisation and access as part of the i2010 European Digital Library initiative, and the Memorandum of Understanding under which a wide range of industry and other stakeholder representatives agreed to proceed on a self-regulatory basis, sector by sector, but incorporating common elements such as due diligence for orphan works searches. We have participated fully in the discussions leading up to these recommendations, represented by the FEP, and we urge the Commission to continue to give this approach their full support, particularly since it appears to be making considerable progress in helping stakeholders to identify a welcome degree of common ground.</FONT></P>
<P class="p64"><FONT class="ft7">www.publishers.org.uk</FONT></P>
<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft5">Page 7 of 37</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_8">

<P class="p65"><FONT class="ft14">We should point out one area of apparent confusion in this section relating to the Google programmes, particularly on pp 8-9 of the Green Paper. The section describing the Google Book Search programme at the third full paragraph of p8 quite rightly describes how this achieves positive results for publishers via an opt-in licensing approach, and many UK publishers are already willingly participating in this programme. However, this opt-in programme is completely different from the Google Library Programme, referred to in the following sentence, which includes the Bodleian Library in the UK (in their case, including public domain works only). The participating libraries in the US, however, are including copyright works held in their collections under assurances from Google that the wholesale copying involved (scanning of whole works) was somehow permissible under US fair use principles. Our US publishing and author colleagues disputed this interpretation of US copyright law, particularly in view of the manifestly commercial nature of Google&#8217;s activities, and took legal action against Google in the US courts. However, a Settlement for this case has been provisionally agreed subject to Court approval in June 2009 on terms which at first sight seem closer to established industry models.</FONT></P>
<P class="p66"><FONT class="ft14">The reference to Google Book Search on p9 of the consultation document should also be to the Google Library Programme, which is where the area of dispute lay. Publishers are perfectly comfortable with licensed programmes such as Google Book Search, but dispute the legality of opt-out programmes for their copyright works which are launched without consultation.</FONT></P>
<P class="p67"><FONT class="ft25">6.</FONT><FONT class="ft26">Should the exception for libraries and archives remain unchanged because publishers themselves will develop online access to their catalogues?</FONT></P>
<P class="p68"><FONT class="ft14">Publishers are not of the view that any copyright exception (or any other law) should remain unchanged for ever. In an environment of rapid and continuing development of digital technology, publishers, like everyone else, need practical, balanced, reasonable copyright exceptions which reflect these developments. If amendments to existing laws are needed, publishers (who are users too, as we have already pointed out), need sensible updating revisions which take all stakeholders&#8217; needs into account (including, of course, those of rights holders, without whose investment the works concerned would not exist in the first place).</FONT></P>
<P class="p69"><FONT class="ft14">Any such revisions should continue to be limited within the Berne Convention three- step test, and where appropriate, in some member states such as the UK, within national limits such as fair dealing. In the UK, our IP Office, implementing the recommendations of the Gowers Review, is already consulting stakeholders on possible revisions to exceptions for libraries and archives, to allow the amendment of provisions which now seem anomalous, for example the strict analogue copy limits for purposes of archiving or preservation, and the original exclusion of copying film or sound records. Within accepted fair dealing limits, and drafted so as not to impinge on normal commercial exploitation, such updating amendments would be sensible. A draft Statutory Instrument is expected along these lines from the UK IP Office in 2009. A similar agreement relating to multiple copies for preservation purposes has been facilitated by the High Level Expert Group.</FONT></P>
<P class="p70"><FONT class="ft14">Other than in the specific circumstances described above, which are currently being addressed in the UK through the recommendations made in the Gowers Review, we do not see the need to amend the exceptions for libraries since online access to</FONT></P>

<P class="p16"><FONT class="ft14">material in both publisher and library catalogues is expanding exponentially (see case study 1, below). We estimate that almost 90% of scholarly journals are now available electronically (see the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers&#8217; publication, </FONT><FONT class="ft16">Scholarly Publishing Practice</FONT><FONT class="ft14">, </FONT><FONT class="ft16">Third Survey, 2008, </FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.alpsp.org</FONT><FONT class="ft14">). In the near future it is reasonable to suppose that the entire catalogues of academic and reference publishers will be available online to libraries.</FONT></P>
<P class="p71"><FONT class="ft27">Case study 1: Academic publishers &#8211; enabling access online</FONT></P>
<P class="p72"><FONT class="ft14">Major academic publishers are now setting up both their frontlist and their active backlist in e-book format. The PA estimates that Taylor and Francis offers over 20,000 e-books, Springer 27,000 and Elsevier 10,000. Further examples of such initiatives are numerous: Elsevier&#8217;s Science Direct; Wiley InterScience, SpringerLink, Oxford Scholarship Online, Ingenta, myilibrary, JStore, and HighWire. Powerful search and abstract services are also available to libraries through programme such as Thomson ISI, Scopus (Elsevier) and Google Scholar.</FONT></P>
<P class="p73"><FONT class="ft14">Consumer trade publishers are also experimenting with e-book retail models at a rapidly expanding rate (see case studies 2 and 3, below). This trend will gather momentum if allowed to develop, and any blanket exception in favour of libraries risks undermining these innovations.</FONT></P>
<P class="p74"><FONT class="ft27">Case study 2: Trade publishers &#8211; developing e-book retail models</FONT></P>
<P class="p75"><FONT class="ft14">Penguin was the first UK publisher to launch an online e-book store in 2001. Penguin has around 1250 e-books available to buy in the UK through its websites and digital delivery supplier Ingrams. Penguin is also in the process of ensuring simultaneous e-book publication on all its frontlist titles. These e-books are available in ePub format, currently compatible with the Sony e-book Reader.

<P class="p84"><FONT class="ft14">All academic and research libraries in the UK offer extensive onsite and remote electronic access to their collections to bona-fide users through registration and access technology such as Athens and Shibboleth. In the UK, all 159 higher education institutions benefit from the NESLi2 licences available through the Joint Information Systems Committee Collections (</FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.nesli2.ac.uk</FONT><FONT class="ft14">), which are now so pervasive as to amount to a national &#8216;opt-in&#8217; provision (see case study 4, below).</FONT></P>

<P class="p93"><FONT class="ft14">Furthermore, any article not available to researchers through their library network can be easily obtained through document delivery services such as those offered by the British Library, either fee-paid for electronic collection via BL Direct, or for a delivery charge only via their library privilege service for research or private study. Many publishers also offer &#8216;pay per view&#8217; services directly from their own platforms.</FONT></P>
<P class="p94"><FONT class="ft14">Again it is recognised that voluntary collective licensing solutions are needed for out of print and orphan works, but we believe the process of collective negotiation will with time provide the most effective solution. Work in this area is already underway following the European Digital Library High Level Expert Group recommendations in June 2008 and through EU-wide projects such as ARROW.</FONT></P>
<P class="p95"><FONT class="ft14">In addition the UK is a world leader in the availability of electronic and online learning material for schools.

<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft14">The Green Paper itself acknowledges that scanning of entire library collections is clearly not permitted under existing EU law without rights holders&#8217; consent, and we see no need for further clarification. We strongly agree with the Green Paper&#8217;s view at p9 that &#8220;if this scanning is undertaken by entities and in circumstances not covered in Article 5(2)(c), rightsholders have to give prior permission for such a reproduction to take place.

<P class="p55"><FONT class="ft14">Not in our view, no. The High Level Expert Group&#8217;s reports of 4 June 2008 clearly recommend a self-regulatory system of sector-specific Codes, via a Memorandum of Understanding, based on certain important common principles, for example due diligence. It is proposed that the sector and national codes should be structured so as to recognise each other on a fully interoperable basis. Publishers were represented on the High Level Expert Group, and support these sensible and practical recommendations. This should preclude any need for a Community Statutory Instrument, or any other EU legislation.</FONT></P>
<P class="p103"><FONT class="ft14">There may appear to be a case for enabling legislation at national level, in some cases, in order to deal with any liability issues which may arise under national law (this has been suggested under UK law, and is the subject of current debate with the UK IP Office, but stakeholders are agreed that any legislation would need to do no more than enable or authorise the self-regulatory system of Codes described above).</FONT></P>
<P class="p104"><FONT class="ft13">11.</FONT><FONT class="ft34">If so, should this be done by amending the 2001 Directive on Copyright in the Information Society or through a stand-alone instrument?</FONT></P>
<P class="p38"><FONT class="ft14">See our response to (10), above. The 2001 Directive has already gone a long way to harmonising EU copyright law, achieving a fair balance after seven years of unprecedented lobbying by all stakeholders. We urge the Commission not to disturb this careful balance simply to deal with the limited special case of orphan works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p105"><FONT class="ft13">12.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">How should the cross-border aspects of the orphan works issue be tackled to ensure EU-wide recognition of the solutions adopted in different Member States?</FONT></P>
<P class="p32"><FONT class="ft14">The High Level Expert Group has already provided for this, by recommending mutual recognition by member states of each others&#8217; sector-specific Codes, on the basis of interoperability. This process is being supported by the ARROW project, which is gathering evidence on current practice in permissions and rights data issues across the EU. Publishers are actively participating in this project and will support its conclusions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft13">3.2 People with a disability</FONT></P>
<P class="p106"><FONT class="ft14">Much progress on accessibility is already being made in the UK, where publishers, authors, agents and booksellers have been in positive and fruitful discussions for some time with visually impaired people and their representatives, such as the RNIB. These discussions have helpfully been facilitated by the UK government. We refer to these discussions in our answer to (1) above. Publishers in the UK are also now extending these discussions to include dyslexic people, under general UK and EU disability law, with an important proviso that any exception should be limited to disabilities directly connected to that person&#8217;s ability to read or access published materials. We believe this is an important proviso &#8211; dyslexia is a complex condition, and not all dyslexics have difficulty reading. There are also disabilities not connected</FONT></P>

<P class="p108"><FONT class="ft14">with reading at all, such as physical disabilities of lower limbs which might require wheelchairs, but not special access to books.</FONT></P>
<P class="p109"><FONT class="ft14">The existing CLA and MPA licences for visually impaired people, cited under (1) above, afford significant benefits above and beyond any applicable exception, but the direct digital access which visually impaired users really want requires trusted and secure arrangements which are currently being tested in pilot schemes, as the examples in (1) illustrate.</FONT></P>
<P class="p53"><FONT class="ft14">On the issue of remuneration, which the Green Paper raises, the UK is proceeding on a pragmatic basis. Traditionally, most author/publisher contracts in the UK licensed the publisher to grant permission to blind people to make accessible copies free of charge, but this was before it became clear that visually impaired people preferred direct but secure access to digital files. The discussions surrounding the two pilot projects in the UK have made it clear to all stakeholders that too little is known about actual conversion costs in this process, which may turn out in practice to be considerable. Visually impaired representatives have made it clear that they do not necessarily expect the analogue &#8217;free&#8217; system to continue, and are willing to enter into reasonable discussions with rights holders and the UK government about any remuneration which may be feasible. This would probably initially be on a cost recovery basis, but all stakeholders are agreed that this matter needs to be kept under review.</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft14">The most recent UK Accessibility Newsletter (Appendix B) contains details of the UK industry&#8217;s progress to date on issues affecting people with a disability. As has already been noted, Appendix A details the PA&#8217;s current guidelines on permissions for visually impaired and disabled people. In addition to these resources, the joint PA and TechDis guidelines for obtaining textbooks in alternative formats can be found here </FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.techdis.ac.uk/getaltformat</FONT><FONT class="ft14">, and the Publisher Lookup UK website, a tool for signposting information and good practice with regard to accessible documents in an educational context, can be found here: </FONT><FONT class="ft15">www.publisherlookup.org.uk</FONT><FONT class="ft14">.</FONT></P>
<P class="p110"><FONT class="ft13">13.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should people with a disability enter into licensing schemes with the publishers in order to increase their access to works? If so, what types of licensing would be most suitable? Are there already licensing schemes in place to increase access to works for the disabled people?</FONT></P>
<P class="p111"><FONT class="ft14">Yes &#8211; see details of licensing schemes in the UK set out above, and at (1). See also the PA&#8217;s guidelines for meeting permissions requests on behalf of reading impaired people at Appendix A.</FONT></P>
<P class="p112"><FONT class="ft13">14.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should there be mandatory provisions that works are made available to people with a disability in a particular format?</FONT></P>
<P class="p113"><FONT class="ft14">Not in our view, no. Mandatory provisions would easily get out of date (unless kept constantly under review). It is important to keep abreast not only of developing technical formats but also the changing needs of the various categories of disabled people. It is difficult to see what mandatory wording would add to the progress already being made, especially in member states such as the UK and Netherlands (this progress is fully described in the FEP response).</FONT></P>

<P class="p114"><FONT class="ft13">15.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should there be a clarification that the current exception benefiting people with a disability applies to disabilities other than visual and hearing disabilities?</FONT></P>
<P class="p115"><FONT class="ft14">We do not believe such a clarification is necessary, or would add anything to the existing generic and clear meaning of the word &#8216;disabled&#8217;. In any event, any such intervention would need to be very carefully worded, so that (as is being proposed in the UK) any further disabilities should clearly be limited to those which directly impact on the person&#8217;s ability to read or access published works (see our response at 3.2 above). In the UK discussions are already taking place between the PA and dyslexics, via BERR and the UK IP Office. It is also likely that the UK IP Office will fit any extension into the existing regime for visually impaired people, so that no exception will apply if and to the extent that a suitable licensing scheme exists.</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft14">Generally, on this issue, we support and agree with the FEP and European Blind Union joint proposal for a platform of stakeholders, rather than any attempt to reopen the 2001 Information Society Directive, which we believe would only cause confusion, and add nothing to progress already being made.</FONT></P>
<P class="p116"><FONT class="ft13">16.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">If so, which other disabilities should be included as relevant for online dissemination of knowledge?</FONT></P>
<P class="p103"><FONT class="ft14">See our response at 3.2 and 15 above. At the time of writing, dyslexia seems a disability with similar characteristics, and in the UK we are discussing possible expansion of the discussions with visually impaired people to accommodate the needs of dyslexics. However, we feel very strongly that the construction of a list of approved disabilities would be extremely unhelpful and inflexible, and would quickly become out of date, as the needs of disabled people, and the technology available to help them, develop. This is something that member states are already obliged to account for, under their existing obligation to disabled people generally.</FONT></P>
<P class="p117"><FONT class="ft13">17.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should national laws clarify that beneficiaries of the exception for people with a disability should not be required to pay remuneration for using a work in order to convert it into an accessible format?</FONT></P>
<P class="p115"><FONT class="ft14">No, since conversion costs might prove to be substantial (see notes on UK pilot schemes at 3.2 above) and there is no reason why publishers alone (as opposed to the state) should be required to shoulder these costs, which are social costs of disability rather than general publishing costs. There are broad social and cultural issues here, which will vary in each member state depending on that member state&#8217;s approach to disabled people and their needs. This is best left to member states. The UK is discussing these issues as part of the two pilot schemes already described, but all the stakeholders have deliberately left open the issue of remuneration until the scale of the actual costs of conversion becomes more clearly known. It may then be for stakeholders to share such costs, if their budgets will allow, or if not ask their national government to intervene, if subsidy is required.</FONT></P>

<P class="p31"><FONT class="ft14">A number of the issues raised in the Green Paper are already being dealt with in the UK through consultation with stakeholders around recommendations from the Gowers Review. Educational and academic publishers, who make up 50% of the PA&#8217;s membership, are of course fully aware of current changes in technology, and have already adapted their publishing to match. At the time of writing, 15-20% of UK publishers&#8217; sales to schools derive from their digital publications (see case study 5, below).</FONT></P>
<P class="p121"><FONT class="ft27">Case study 5: Online learning provisions for schools</FONT></P>
<P class="p122"><FONT class="ft14">The educational publisher Nelson Thornes is the first to provide all its new electronic content online, rather than on CD Rom, and offers a portal providing teaching support, guides and lesson plans which support a large and diverse range of courses set by the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance, the largest of the three English exam boards, at both GCSE and A-level.</FONT></P>
<P class="p123"><FONT class="ft14">In early 2009 Dorling Kindersley will be announcing a partnership with Promethean. This will allow teachers to buy the bestselling Eyewitness children&#8217;s reference titles in chunked content and use them to create and teach lessons using the latest whiteboard technology.</FONT></P>
<P class="p124"><FONT class="ft14">Hodder Education&#8217;s e-learning platform Dynamic Learning provides content which is ready to use in virtual learning environments, enabling teachers to create interactive lessons through the Lesson Builder function, and allowing students to personalise the content of their textbooks and resources.</FONT></P>
<P class="p125"><FONT class="ft14">To reflect this, publishers are supporting limited amendments to existing copyright exceptions at sections 35 and 36 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in order to allow for distance learning needs, and the rise of virtual learning environments (VLEs), interactive whiteboards etc., but only to the extent that no licensing schemes exist (extended licensing schemes are also under discussion). Publishers will support such developments, provided they are kept within the three- step test limitations, preventing any conflict with normal exploitation, and preferably not coming into effect if a licensing scheme is already available (as in the UK). We also need &#8220;educational establishments&#8221; to be defined narrowly and carefully within Article 5.2 of the Information Society Directive, which provides that such establishments must be limited to publicly accessible establishments which are &#8220;not</FONT></P>

<P class="p131"><FONT class="ft14">Vitalsource &#8211; a retail partner aimed directly at students offering e-book versions of over 20 higher education textbooks made available through John Smith's bookstores. E-books are either packaged with the main text or as a stand-alone version. The Vitalsource platform is downloadable and allows students to view their e-book on or offline. The e-book can be highlighted, printed (in part) and allows the student to make notes. Notes and highlights can be shared amongst other students who have also purchased the text.</FONT></P>
<P class="p132"><FONT class="ft14">Custom publishing &#8211; Pearson's custom programme enables academics to develop bespoke texts according to their specific teaching requirements. Many customers opt to receive e-book chapters, often packaged with a physical textbook. The e-book chapters are delivered either through a password protected website or a learning management system. The chapters can be combined with the many other online resources Pearson have created to support their texts.</FONT></P>
<P class="p133"><FONT class="ft14">MyLabs &#8211; these are web-based interactive learning programmes containing diagnostic assessment material and learning support material including e-book versions of the textbooks that the MyLab supports.

<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft14">This is already being discussed in the UK (see 3.3, above). However, there are obvious risks to normal commercial exploitation if care is not taken to define research narrowly so as to exclude commercial research and to keep any proposed clarification within the three-step test.

<P class="p139"><FONT class="ft13">22.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should there be mandatory minimum rules as to the length of the excerpts from works which can be reproduced or made available for teaching and research purposes?</FONT></P>
<P class="p140"><FONT class="ft14">We have found previous &#8216;rule of thumb&#8217; rules relating to permitted word length to be extremely confusing and unhelpful in the UK, since under UK law fair dealing is as much a matter of </FONT><FONT class="ft16">quality </FONT><FONT class="ft14">as of quantity, and recent judgements have shown that taking even comparatively short excerpts can still fall outside the fair dealing rules and count as copyright infringement, if a sufficiently &#8220;substantial&#8221; part is taken without consent. There are certain designated limits remaining in the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (for example, reprographic copying of up to 1% of certain works by educational establishments under s. 36(2)), although these have often been improved upon in collective licences, for example CLA licences permitting 5% under certain circumstances. We strongly believe that new mandatory rules from the EU Commission relating to the length of excerpts which may be made available under exceptions would only confuse matters more, and would not do justice to the considerable experience built up over many years by national laws.</FONT></P>

We doubt very much whether such a US fair use style exception, coming from a jurisdiction with a very different language and jurisprudence from that of either the EU or indeed the UK, could be introduced into EU law, without the potential for serious damage to the legitimate interests of rightsholders. The evidence cited by the Gowers Review for such a recommendation was distinctly limited, depending on the sole example of hip hop music. Although the Green Paper refers to &#8220;calls&#8221; (plural) for such an exception, it also provides no evidence of any other calls than the sole Gowers example of hip hop. We are not aware of any evidence in the publishing world ourselves, certainly no evidence which might justify any broadly-based exception in terms which are bound to become the basis of dispute and litigation across a whole range of creative industries.</FONT></P>
<P class="p143"><FONT class="ft14">The Green Paper alleges that current copyright requirements for prior permission &#8220;can be perceived as a barrier to innovation&#8221;, without any mention of current industry progress towards increasingly prompt and user-friendly access via rights management technologies such as ACAP, or indeed of the High Level Expert Group&#8217;s recent recommendations relating to orphan and out of print works, all of which are actively reducing this &#8220;perceived&#8221; problem. There is every sign that market solutions are well under way here, which would remove any need for Commission intervention.</FONT></P>
<P class="p103"><FONT class="ft14">Finally, the suggestions that user created content could legitimately be included under Articles 5(3)(d) and 5(3)(k), dealing with the very different and distinct areas of criticism and review, and caricature, parody and pastiche respectively, would involve significant, illogical and unjustified extensions to the accepted language and meaning of current exceptions. In our view these would fall well outside the Berne Convention three-step test and be highly detrimental to the legitimate interests of rightsholders, without meeting any evidence of consumer need.</FONT></P>
<P class="p144"><FONT class="ft13">24.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should there be more precise rules regarding what acts end users can or cannot do when making use of materials protected by copyright?</FONT></P>
<P class="p145"><FONT class="ft14">Not in our view, no. The 2001 Information Society Directive went a very long way towards harmonising EU rules relating to permitted copyright uses, itself implementing the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996. In the process, a crucial balance between the interests of all stakeholders was achieved. The Directive is still in the process of being effectively implemented across the EU and there is no evidence that further or different rules are necessary. Evidence of flexibility under existing rules is already emerging from some member states (see the FEP submission for references to Germany and France), and we strongly believe that EU law, harmonised recently after so many years of consultation and compromise on all sides, already has the flexibility to deal with any perceived problems.</FONT></P>

<P class="p147"><FONT class="ft13">25.</FONT><FONT class="ft33">Should an exception for user-created content be introduced into the Directive?</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft14">No, emphatically not. We believe very strongly that there is no proven need for any such exception and that if it were introduced it would almost inevitably lead to further uncertainty. Users who create their own original content already have the benefit of copyright protection for that content, under existing EU copyright law, even if they are creating adaptations of existing works. However, there is a significant difference between original content which is truly &#8216;user-created&#8217; and non-original uses or linkages, particularly if made for commercial purposes by third party entrepreneurs such as ISPs or search engines. There is a risk that such non-original content may amount to little more than purely derivative uses of other people&#8217;s content without consent, which would not in any way justify the protection of an EU copyright exception. In our view, such merely &#8216;user-generated&#8217; content would clearly fall outside the Berne Convention three-step test, particularly in jeopardising normal exploitation of the copyright works concerned.</FONT></P>

<P class="p65"><FONT class="ft1">Appendix A: Publisher guidelines for meeting permissions requests on behalf of reading impaired people</FONT></P>
<P class="p149"><FONT class="ft36">September 2007</FONT></P>
<P class="p150"><FONT class="ft37">These Guidelines have been developed by The Publishers Association after extensive consultation to assist publishers in responding effectively to requests on behalf of people with reading impairments, particularly visually impaired people (referred to throughout as VIPs), in order to facilitate access to their material. It is the intention that these Guidelines can be refined and improved over time, and any comment or suggestion should be sent to Graham Taylor at the PA (</FONT><FONT class="ft38">gtaylor@publishers.org.uk</FONT><FONT class="ft37">).</FONT></P>
<P class="p151"><FONT class="ft37">The Guidelines derive from an initiative by the copyright committee of the academic and professional division, and thanks are due for their input, especially to Clare Hodder, Kevin Taylor, and Hugh Jones. Thanks are also due for valuable input from Alistair McNaught, TechDis Senior Advisor and to colleagues from RNIB. These Guidelines are offered as suggestions for good practice and do not constitute legal advice.</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft37">This guidance falls into two sections:</FONT></P>
<P class="p152"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft39">Specific detailed guidance on granting permissions to visually impaired people, for whom the law offers significant accommodations.</FONT></P>
<P class="p153"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft39">More general guidance on maximising the accessibility of digital versions of text for the benefit of all users with reading impairment.</FONT></P>

<P class="p155"><FONT class="ft40">Guidelines for granting permissions to visually impaired people in the UK (and others who have difficulty accessing text)</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft41">Publishers and Disabled People</FONT></P>
<P class="p156"><FONT class="ft37">Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, it is illegal for &#8216;service providers&#8217; to discriminate against disabled people (including visually impaired people (VIPs)). The legislation is mainly aimed at libraries, schools, shops, restaurants and hotels, but &#8216;service providers&#8217; probably includes those who pro vide goods as well as services to the public, i.e. publishers of either printed or electronic books or electronic services such as websites.</FONT></P>
<P class="p157"><FONT class="ft37">&#8216;Discriminating&#8217; is widely defined as &#8220;treating les s favourably&#8221;, or failing to make &#8220;reasonable adjustments&#8221; to account for the disabil ity concerned. If necessary, a service provider must now provide &#8220;a reasonable alt ernative method&#8221; of making its services available to disabled people where a physical feature makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to use them. Publishers are not required to produce Braille or talking book editions of every book published, but may rely on, for example, a reasonably accessible licensing scheme.</FONT></P>
<P class="p158"><FONT class="ft41">Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002</FONT></P>
<P class="p159"><FONT class="ft37">VIPs now benefit from a copyright exception under the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002. The Act in fact provides two different exceptions with slightly different conditions, as follows:</FONT></P>
<P class="p55"><FONT class="ft42">1. Single copies for personal use</FONT></P>
<P class="p160"><FONT class="ft37">Individual VIPs may make, free of charge, single &#8216;accessible copies&#8217; in other formats, such as Braille or for adapted computer use, for their own personal use, or they may ask others (such as teachers or librarians) to make such copies for them, without infringing copyright, provided that:</FONT></P>
<P class="p161"><FONT class="ft37">The copies are made from lawfully acquired originals, are not adapted unnecessarily and are not passed on to others.</FONT></P>
<P class="p162"><FONT class="ft37">The copies are accompanied by a statement that they are made under the Act, and carry a sufficient acknowledgment.</FONT></P>
<P class="p163"><FONT class="ft37">This means that individual VIPs, or those acting for them, no longer need to seek permission to make single copies for personal use. This applies to commercially published literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works and to published editions (i.e. typographical copyright), but it does </FONT><FONT class="ft43">not </FONT><FONT class="ft37">apply to recorded performances or databases.</FONT></P>
<P class="p164"><FONT class="ft7">www.publishers.org.uk</FONT></P>
<P class="p92"><FONT class="ft5">Page 21 of 37</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_22">

<P class="p165"><FONT class="ft42">2. Multiple copies for collective use</FONT></P>
<P class="p166"><FONT class="ft37">Organisations such as the RNIB may make multiple copies for their members of the same copyright works if both of the provisos set out above are complied with, but </FONT><FONT class="ft43">only </FONT><FONT class="ft37">provided that no licensing scheme exists. In fact, a Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) licence is now available, so organisations wishing to make multiple copies still need to seek permission, ideally via the CLA licence. Any copies made under this exception must incorporate any (or equally effective) copy-protection applied to the original, so far as reasonably practicable, unless agreed otherwise.</FONT></P>
<P class="p158"><FONT class="ft42">What this means in practice</FONT></P>
<P class="p167"><FONT class="ft37">1.</FONT><FONT class="ft44">An individual VIP seeking to make a single copy for personal use does not now need to ask permission at all, provided the above conditions are complied with. However, if a VIP (or teacher, librarian etc. acting on the VIP&#8217;s behalf) does ask for permission, a publisher may wish to issue a free licence so that they have a record of the use, or if the VIP specifically requests such a document for their own records. This need only be a very simple document confirming that the VIP has the right to make a copy and listing the above conditions.</FONT></P>
<P class="p168"><FONT class="ft37">2.</FONT><FONT class="ft44">Organisations seeking to make multiple copies still need a licence to do so, and should be referred to the CLA (whose address is: Saffron House, 6-10 Kirby Street, London EC1N 8TS: http://www.cla.co.uk/).</FONT></P>
<P class="p55"><FONT class="ft41">Access to Digital Files &#8211; a Feasibility Study</FONT></P>
<P class="p169"><FONT class="ft37">As a result of discussions chaired by the DTI and involving RNIB, NLB, publishers and relevant trade associations, a Scoping Project began in 2006 to investigate the potential for bringing about a significant increase in accessible book products for VIPs.</FONT></P>
<P class="p170"><FONT class="ft37">Central to the project is investigation of the extent to which published material can be made available in digital form, then converted and processed into large print, Braille and audio products. Investigations will include looking at the feasibility of bringing these accessible products into mainstream bookshops as well as through existing distribution methods and new online services. The project involves a wide range of stakeholders and interests.</FONT></P>
<P class="p171"><FONT class="ft37">The project is being led by RNIB, who are the project sponsor, and managed by an independent project manager. A steering group with broad representation and chaired by DTI has been established along with a smaller project management team with representatives from the Publishers Licensing Society, The Booksellers Association, Book Industry Communication and RNIB. These representatives are co-ordinating the input required from other organisations and individuals. The Feasibility Project will report in March 2007 and whatever it recommends will be subject to wider consultation and approval before subsequent implementation of recommendations.</FONT></P>

<P class="p173"><FONT class="ft41">Good Practice in Responding to a Permissions Request for Visually Impaired Use</FONT></P>
<P class="p174"><FONT class="ft37">Remember that if the applicant is an individual seeking permission to convert a legitimately acquired book to accessible formats by scanning, they have a statutory right to do so anyway (subject to the conditions listed above) and can be told this in a brief e-mail or by way of a simple licence.</FONT></P>
<P class="p151"><FONT class="ft45">Consolidate responses from your company. </FONT><FONT class="ft37">Try to ensure that everyone in your company knows that permissions requests of this nature should always be forwarded to the same department to ensure consistency of approach and careful record keeping. Well-meaning colleagues could easily send out files if they receive a request directly, which could cause complications. It may be helpful to post a clear contact for such requests on your website, with a link to RNIB for further advice.</FONT></P>
<P class="p151"><FONT class="ft45">Respond promptly</FONT><FONT class="ft37">. You should aim to get back to the applicant as soon as possible to acknowledge receipt and advise next steps. If possible, you should aim to have fulfilled the request within two weeks of receipt, and all the better if you can do so sooner. Remember that learning support departments often have little notice, if any, that they need to prepare materials for someone with a visual impairment. In some cases, students can effectively be denied access to reading materials for weeks after their peers as a result of waiting for files, and in the worst cases don&#8217;t get access to appropriate materials until after their course has been completed.</FONT></P>
<P class="p175"><FONT class="ft45">Clarify what is being requested and the use to which the material will be put. </FONT><FONT class="ft37">It&#8217;s worth doing this straight away to ensure you are providing what is wanted. The applicant does not have a statutory right to obtain an electronic file from you (only to scan from a legitimately acquired original), but in many cases you will be asked for an electronic file to facilitate the end-user&#8217;s conversion of the book into an appropriate format. Sometimes you may find that you already publish an e-book version of the title in question, in a form that will be of use to the applicant, and in such a case you can simply suggest that they purchase the e-book. And sometimes you will be asked for permission to do things which are covered by a CLA licence - in which case you just need to explain the position to the applicant and point them in the appropriate direction. It&#8217;s well worth picking up the phone for a discussion with the applicant if the request is at all unclear or you suspect the applicant is asking for the wrong thing or you think you can provide a better alternative.</FONT></P>
<P class="p176"><FONT class="ft45">Always issue an appropriate licence if requested</FONT><FONT class="ft37">, and especially if you are supplying electronic files. Make it clear that the files are being provided for the sole purpose of making an accessible version of the content for a named visually impaired person for his/her own personal non-commercial use, and for no other purpose. Record details of the licence that has been granted and any files or other materials supplied. Security of files is an issue for publishers. Unfortunately locking up files with technical protection methods often means the file cannot be converted and renders it useless. In most cases therefore files will need to be sent out &#8216;on trust&#8217;. A carefully worded</FONT></P>

<P class="p92"><FONT class="ft5">Page 23 of 37</FONT></P>

<DIV id="page_24">

<P class="p178"><FONT class="ft37">licence outlining the terms and conditions under which material is being supplied and countersigned by the applicant will help ensure the security of your files. [An example of such a licence is included in Appendix 1.] It is important to record what has been sent out and to whom, so that you are able to track back if any misuse is reported at a later date.</FONT></P>
<P class="p179"><FONT class="ft46">Consider your policy on charging for provision of files</FONT><FONT class="ft47">. Some publishers issue files or other materials free of charge, others charge a recovery cost or handling fee, often equivalent to the cover price of the printed copy. Some publishers supply material free of charge but require that the applicant has purchased a copy of the book they wish to convert. It is really up to individual publishers to determine what they feel is appropriate. There is no statutory requirement to supply materials free of charge. However, it would not be appropriate to charge over the odds for supply of such material, and the 2002 Act also provides that copies made must not be charged at more than the cost of making and supplying them. Whatever the policy, be very clear about it from the beginning so the applicant knows what to expect. If the applicant is insistent on you providing a file in a format that you have to have specially converted and will incur additional cost, discuss that with the applicant and establish (a) whether it is necessary and (b) if they will accept a share, or the whole, of the additional cost.</FONT></P>
<P class="p180"><FONT class="ft45">You do not need to provide Word files. </FONT><FONT class="ft37">These are frequently asked for but mostly not necessary. Learning Support Departments can usually convert PDFs into an appropriate format for the end user. If in doubt discuss the specific requirements with the appropriate technical people in your company and those of the applicant.</FONT></P>
<P class="p163"><FONT class="ft45">Try to avoid licensing individuals</FONT><FONT class="ft37">. It is preferable wherever possible to license an institution or organisation rather than individual students or employees. In this way the institution or organisation takes responsibility for ensuring that the terms of any licence are adhered to and can provide confirmation that the individual is entitled to the licence.</FONT></P>
<P class="p181"><FONT class="ft41">Responding to those who have difficulty accessing text by conventional means</FONT></P>
<P class="p182"><FONT class="ft37">Disability legislation in the UK applies to all those who have a substantial, continuing disability which means they cannot carry out normal day to day activities. This almost certainly includes not being able to access content conventionally. There are many more people in education with these kinds of problems than there are those who are visually impaired and they have the same rights under general disability legislation but they do not benefit from the special copyright exceptions for visually impaired people set out in the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002. Applications on behalf of these users should still be treated in a way that does not discriminate against them, although this may include access to reasonable alternatives, such as a licensing scheme.</FONT></P>

<P class="p186"><FONT class="ft42">Accessible texts &#8211; who are they for?</FONT></P>
<P class="p13"><FONT class="ft37">Traditional paper-based publishing can create problems, in terms of accessing the educational content, for a wide range of people. For example:</FONT></P>
<P class="p187"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft50">Many readers struggle to effectively skim read written materials for key words or concepts.</FONT></P>
<P class="p188"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft50">Many readers, particularly older or disabled readers, have difficulties with font style, size or contrast, making the text hard to &#8216;see&#8217; and difficult to read.</FONT></P>
<P class="p188"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft50">Many dyslexic readers can &#8216;see&#8217; text but have diffi culties in processing its meaning.</FONT></P>
<P class="p189"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft44">Some readers have too little vision to see text.</FONT></P>
<P class="p188"><FONT class="ft9">&#183;</FONT><FONT class="ft50">Some readers with motor control issues may have difficulties in handling a book or turning pages.</FONT></P>
<P class="p190"><FONT class="ft37">For all these groups the most significant drawback of traditional publishing is the inflexibility of the final medium. By contrast, text in digital form can be displayed in many ways (depending on suitability for the reader) or, if appropriate, read aloud by a software package.</FONT></P>
<P class="p191"><FONT class="ft37">As the implications of the Disability Discrimination Act become more apparent, more learners will be demanding digital versions of books. Tutors, librarians and disability officers will be actively seeking to meet this need. In fact, VIPs represent only 2.8% of disabled people in Higher Education.</FONT></P>
<P class="p192"><FONT class="ft42">Altered Font Size and Style</FONT></P>
<P class="p193"><FONT class="ft37">Many readers &#8211; with or without a disability - can b enefit from adjusting font size, style and colour contrasts. Those with modest demands can achieve this within existing software (e.g. Adobe&#174; Acrobat Reader) but those with greater needs may need to use screen magnification software.</FONT></P>

<P class="p196"><FONT class="ft42">Text-to-Speech</FONT></P>
<P class="p197"><FONT class="ft37">A range of users benefit from hearing the text read out to them. Text in digital format can easily be converted to speech using appropriate (and easily available) software. Now that free versions of text-to-speech software are available the demand to have text in a digital format is likely to increase substantially.</FONT></P>
<P class="p198"><FONT class="ft53">Figure 2 Text-to-speech software can read content aloud to the user</FONT></P>
<P class="p199"><FONT class="ft42">Screen Readers</FONT></P>
<P class="p160"><FONT class="ft47">For some readers with no vision the only realistic option for accessing content is to have an electronic version that can be read by a Screen Reader. A Screen Reader is significantly different from text-to-speech software as it not only has to read the textual content, it also has to provide navigation and structural information. For example, whether a line of text is a structural heading or just a short sentence and, if a heading, whether it is a sub heading or heralds a new chapter. If this vital information is available within the structure of the document it becomes considerably easier for a blind person to visualise the relationships between different concepts.</FONT></P>
<P class="p200"><FONT class="ft42">What formats are accessible?</FONT></P>
<P class="p201"><FONT class="ft37">To be suitable as a medium for VIPs, the format used must be capable of being accessible. The format must also be popular with users and thus easy and familiar to those who will want to use it. Of all the many formats available this limits the candidates to a very familiar list: Microsoft&#174; Wor d, Rich Text Format and Adobe&#174; PDFs. There is one further format with an international standard called DAISY. This format, becoming popular in the United States and Scandinavia, has very big advantages but is currently far less familiar to UK users.</FONT></P>
<P class="p199"><FONT class="ft42">The importance of structure</FONT></P>
<P class="p142"><FONT class="ft37">Most Screen Reader software will read from a block of text that has no inbuilt &#8216;structure&#8217;. This can make it very difficult to und erstand the result if you cannot see the screen itself. For visually impaired users this lack of &#8216;structure&#8217; can necessitate listening to the whole document in order to be sure of the content. For those with other reading difficulties it can present a mass of intimidating text. However, if a document has been created with inbuilt structure (headings, sections and bookmarks), a Screen Reader can interpret the parts of the document for the visually impaired reader. Structure also makes it easier for everyone to scan the publication for the part they want. Once a document has structure this is usually retained when formats are changed, so the earlier in the process this happens the less time it is likely to take to rectify later.</FONT></P>

<P class="p196"><FONT class="ft42">Examples of structured and unstructured documents</FONT></P>
<P class="p203"><FONT class="ft47">Figure 3 shows a structured document in Microsoft&#174; Word. The Document Map has been enabled and is showing the structure of the document in the left hand pane of the screen. The use of the Document Map enables a user to navigate to appropriate sections of the document via a collapsible/expandable menu which hyperlinks to document headings.</FONT></P>
<P class="p204"><FONT class="ft47">Figure 4 shows the same document in Microsoft&#174; Word. The print versions (right hand side) look identical but, because formatting was used to define headings rather than structural styles, the Document Map cannot create an intelligent collapsible navigation navigable by a Screen Reader.</FONT></P>
<P class="p205"><FONT class="ft42">Where does the structure come from?</FONT></P>
<P class="p94"><FONT class="ft37">Sadly few authors produce documents with inbuilt structure, tending instead to use bold text or enlarged font to define new sections. The importance of effective structure, using inbuilt styles, needs to be emphasised more vigorously in the guidance notes to authors. Alternatively, a reasonable structure can be inserted into a publication at the mark-up stage or by the typesetter if software like Adobe&#174; Acrobat or InDesign&#174; is used.</FONT></P>

<P class="p165"><FONT class="ft42">Where can we start?</FONT></P>
<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft36">Editing</FONT></P>
<P class="p207"><FONT class="ft37">In order to include structure in a publication, information has to be entered at the electronic mark-up or typesetting stages. Information on headings, sections and subsections, footnotes and references has to be identified. This information, the key to making the document accessible, can be added to the other changes that have to be made at this stage.</FONT></P>
<P class="p208"><FONT class="ft36">Images</FONT></P>
<P class="p209"><FONT class="ft37">Images are a particular difficulty for those with visual impairment. An essential part of the structural information of a document is a description of any image. This description is read out to the Screen Reader user. The best person to provide this description is the originator of the document, who will be able to make the description meaningful. (Images tagged as &#8216;picture of building&#8217; are rarely useful!)</FONT></P>
<P class="p210"><FONT class="ft36">The way forward</FONT></P>
<P class="p211"><FONT class="ft37">By adopting additional procedures in the authoring and editing process, books and publications can be set up with the structure that will make them much more accessible to millions of potential users. Although some areas - for example, mathematical symbols - remain problematical, most documents can be hugely improved to ensure their usefulness and accessibility to new audiences who are increasingly demanding information in digital formats.</FONT></P>
