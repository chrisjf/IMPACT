<P class="p1"><FONT class="ft0">EC Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy Submitted By</FONT></P>
<P class="p2"><FONT class="ft1">The Software & Information Industry Association</FONT></P>
<P class="p3"><FONT class="ft2">November 24, 2008</FONT></P>
<P class="p4"><FONT class="ft2">With over 500 member companies, the Software & Information Industry Association (&#8220;SIIA&#8221;) is the principal trade association of the software code and information content industry. Our members are global industry leaders in the development and marketing of software and electronic content for business, education, consumers and the Internet. SIIA counts among its members the majority of the world&#8217;s publishers of research, science and educational materials (</FONT><FONT class="ft3">i.e.</FONT><FONT class="ft2">, &#8220;knowledge products&#8221;), including The McGraw-Hill Companies, Reed Elsevier Inc., and The Thomson Corporation and many others with substantial numbers of customers and investments in the European Union.</FONT></P>
<P class="p5"><FONT class="ft2">We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the EC Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy. Many of the questions contained in the Paper relate to potential expansion and/or clarification of exceptions in copyright law. Any alteration to the exceptions found in copyright law are of significant concern to software and information publishers as it could have the effect of offsetting the delicate balance between the rights of copyright owners and the interests of users. In a world in which piracy of copyrighted works is so easy and persistent, any expansion of existing copyright law exceptions will only serve to further reduce the rights afforded to copyrighted owners and the corresponding incentives of authors to create and disseminate new copyrighted works for the public to enjoy. We understand the need to address the interests of users in getting access to copyrighted materials, but we think there are ways to do this &#8211; for instance, through voluntary licensing schemes &#8211; without unnecessarily expanding or unduly continuing exceptions in copyright law.</FONT></P>
<P class="p6"><FONT class="ft2">To the extent the law includes any exceptions it is essential that they comply with the Berne Convention&#8217;s three-step test, which requires the exception be limited to: (1) certain special cases; (2) which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work; and (3) which do not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the rights holder. This test establishes the essential balance between the rights of owners with the interests of users and should be strongly adhered to when crafting any exceptions under the copyright law. It should not be assumed that just because a work is used for educational or research purposes that use does not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work. Many materials are developed specifically for the academic</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_2">

<P class="p7"><FONT class="ft2">and research markets. Creating or applying an exception broadly to these works could dramatically damage their value and therefore would not comply with the Berne three-step test.</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">Please find below SIIA&#8217;s specific responses t the questions posed the Green Paper.</FONT></P>
<P class="p4"><FONT class="ft4">Section 2: General Issues</FONT></P>
<P class="p9"><FONT class="ft3">(1) Should there be encouragement or guidelines for contractual arrangements between right holders and users for the implementation of copyright exceptions?</FONT></P>
<P class="p10"><FONT class="ft2">It is essential that the basic principle of freedom of contract be recognized and preserved by any copyright legislation. As a general rule, nothing in the law should restrict the rights of parties to enter freely into licenses or any other contracts with respect to the use of copyrighted works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p11"><FONT class="ft2">Over time, licensing solutions have proven to be more flexible and preferable than inflexible legal exceptions that governments are notoriously slow to change once they become outdated. Parties should retain the freedom to structure an agreement as they desire, with some exception (such as provisions relating to consumer protections). This is more important now then ever before because in an increasingly digital knowledge economy it is almost certain that software and information publishers will make their products and services available subject to critical contractual terms.</FONT></P>
<P class="p12"><FONT class="ft2">The Internet has permanently changed the relationship between users and the software and information industries. Electronic commerce has provided users with more options, more alternatives and more opportunities than ever before. The richness and inherent value of electronic commerce and high-tech products to consumers is derived from the wide availability of software and content and the ease by which these products and services can be realized by people using new high-tech products. For users of products and services that incorporate software and/or information, electronic commerce facilitated through licensing provides a robust new delivery channel. By using the Internet to deliver software and digital content, users can take advantage of the lower transaction costs, simplified delivery systems, direct interaction with the provider, and minimal time-to-market.</FONT></P>
<P class="p13"><FONT class="ft2">People will be able to take advantage of new technologies and business models only to the extent that the laws do not inhibit the creation and use of new technologies and business models. If the law creates undue burdens on providers that raise transactional costs, without producing any corresponding tangible benefits to users, in the end, only the users&#8217; interests will be harmed. This is especially true where the legal requirement on the provider is one that the user cares little about or has the ability to secure in the absence of any legal requirement.</FONT></P>
<P class="p14"><FONT class="ft2">For instance, the average person who licenses software and informational products does not decide whether to license a product or service based on whether they can make a back-up copy of the product, transfer the product or take advantage of some other exception in the copyright law. In reality, the person will ultimately decide whether to purchase a product or service based on factors such as price, compatibility, or brand loyalty.</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_3">

<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft2">There is an incentive for publishers of information products to try to extend the audience for their products through a pricing strategy called price differentiation-that is, through charging different prices for the same or very similar information to different users or to users seeking different packages of information. Software publishers use a similar strategy to make their products more widely available by distributing educational and OEM versions of their software. However, these publishers will not be able to extend the audience for their products through price differentiation unless copying and resale are controlled through adequate statutory protection that does not impinge upon the principle of freedom of contract.</FONT></P>
<P class="p16"><FONT class="ft2">Fortunately for users, market dynamics and the law are already working to ensure that the only business practices that will survive in the long-term are those that balance convenience, price and consumer protections. As users become more educated and aware of their choices, businesses that do not effectively respond to online user preferences and interests will simply fade away. In response to user demand, publishers have created many different types of licenses, which vary greatly depending on the customer needs. Such licenses include, site licenses, pay-per-use licenses, click-through agreements, and &#8220;true-up&#8221; agreements, to name just a few.</FONT></P>
<P class="p17"><FONT class="ft2">Software and information publishers are able, through licensing to meet customer needs &#8211; whether the general public or discrete customer groups &#8211; and at the same time protect against misuse of their rights. If undue restrictions are placed on either the ability of those publishers to license or the manner in which publishers license, they may be less willing to widely distribute their products and services to the public. This is especially true with mass market click through agreements. Certain informational products can only be distributed freely through the use of license terms and conditions. If these terms could not be enforced these products may not be distributed, and in some cases, the incentive to create certain products may have be so reduced that these new products would never have been created.</FONT></P>
<P class="p18"><FONT class="ft2">In sum, we are of the strong belief that government involvement in licensing, whether it be through guidelines or model agreements or through legislative mandates, would hinder innovation and dissemination. Accordingly, we do not believe that such government involvement is not appropriate.</FONT></P>

<P class="p25"><FONT class="ft4">Section 3.1: Exceptions For Libraries And Archives</FONT></P>
<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft3">(6) Should the exception for libraries and archives remain unchanged because publishers themselves will develop online access to their catalogues</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">Yes. If the goal is to &#8220;increase access to works,&#8221; there are many ways to achieve that goal. In the past, the primary means for achieving that goal may have been by making works publicly accessible through libraries and other organizations. However, the advent of new digital technologies and new business models has resulted in more works being publicly accessible than ever before. No longer limited by geography or unwieldy hardware, people across the globe can access copyrighted works online anytime, anywhere. They are able to access a mind-numbing variety of copyrighted works, ranging from entertainment products, like movies, music and video games, to informational products, like books, articles, and databases, from copyright owners or their licensees located all over the world.</FONT></P>
<P class="p27"><FONT class="ft2">For years libraries have been making available to their patrons traditional print versions of copyrighted works in their collections and the collections of other libraries. Long ago, this was recognized as an act that should be given special treatment under the copyright law. However, the fact that such special treatment was found to be warranted decades ago does not mean the same justifications still exist today to warrant continued special treatment -- and it certainly does not mean the same justifications can automatically be extended to digital works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p28"><FONT class="ft2">When the exceptions for libraries and archives were first enacted, if someone wanted to obtain a particular article or an entire work for their review, it was likely that their only option was to find the time to trudge down to their local (or not so local) library to get a copy. Today, however, with the advent of the Internet and other digital technologies, that very same article or work is often easily accessible from a variety of online resources from the comfort of their home or office.</FONT></P>
<P class="p29"><FONT class="ft2">If users are able to obtain content without resorting to their library or archive, then expanding existing exceptions to grant libraries and archives broader abilities to make content available to users only serves to put libraries in direct competition with those who are already providing access to the content, namely the owners of copyrighted materials and their designated licensees. If, however, there are specific copyrighted works that are not being made available to users, we believe that existing law addresses those needs. In instances where that may not be the case,</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_5">

<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft2">then libraries and archives must present a strong and convincing case that changes in law are necessary to better provide access to works to their users.</FONT></P>
<P class="p31"><FONT class="ft2">So the question thus becomes are publishers making their works available online. The answer is a resounding &#8220;yes.&#8221; Many publishers have made or are working to make their works available and searchable on the Internet and for archival and preservation purposes, including works originally produced in analog format. For instance, in 2002 Elsevier entered into an agreement with the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (National Library of the Netherlands), which agreed to be a digital archive for all Elsevier journals. Then in 2005 Elsevier entered into an agreement with Portico, an independent not-for-profit organization maintaining dark digital archives. All ScienceDirect Elsevier journals and the eBook Collection are being deposited permanently with Portico, and all libraries can decide to join Portico and have assured access through Portico should access via the publisher no longer be possible. In addition, as noted above, Elsevier has authorized Portico to offer post-termination access in the event a library ceases to be a ScienceDirect subscriber. Following a two-year beta test, in 2008 Elsevier also agreed to participate in CLOCKSS, a distributed publisher-library community archive system. This international program provides for locally-held dark archives around the world for journals published 2008 and following. Finally, since 1996 Elsevier has licensed its ScienceDirect service for local hosting (ScienceDirect OnSite) and there are approximately ten major library centers around the world that hold all or virtually all Elsevier titles locally. While these libraries are not official archives, their possession of the digital files provides significant reassurance that these files will not disappear or otherwise be inaccessible to the research community.</FONT></P>
<P class="p32"><FONT class="ft2">Other examples include the H.W. Wilson Business Periodicals Index series, which is a comprehensive bibliographic citation database retrospective to 1913 </FONT><A href="http://www.hwwilson.com/Databases/business_retro.htm"><FONT class="ft6">http://www.hwwilson.com/Databases/business_retro.htm </FONT></A><FONT class="ft2">and NAPC, which provides an searchable online &#8220;Periodicals in Microform Catalog&#8221; at </FONT><A href="http://www.napubco.com/catalog.html"><FONT class="ft6">http://www.napubco.com/catalog.html</FONT></A><A href="http://www.napubco.com/catalog.html"><FONT class="ft2">.</FONT></A></P>
<P class="p20"><FONT class="ft2">In short, virtually all scientific, technical and medical journal articles are publicly available online. The same is true for articles found in traditional magazines, newspapers, newsletters and similar periodicals. More and more, digital versions of textbooks and other books are also making their way online. Ultimately, the goal is for entire catalogues to be digitized and made available online. While an individual publisher may not be able to complete this enormous task alone, publishers have generally been supportive of digitizing projects managed by third parties and licensees provided the publisher retains the ultimate authority and control to determine whether and how their works may be digitized and made available.</FONT></P>
<P class="p33"><FONT class="ft2">Perhaps the biggest impediment to publishers making their works widely available online is the significant risk that once they do so their works will be pirated and their value destroyed. To the extent governments: (1) enact laws that provide strong protections for copyrighted works and strong disincentives and penalties for piracy, and (2) take effective and prompt criminal action against those who violate copyright laws by making pirated copies publicly available, publishers will be more inclined to make their copyrighted works more widely available to consumers and users either through license agreements with libraries or through their own means. Consequently, if governments want to take any action in this area the best approach would be</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_6">

<P class="p30"><FONT class="ft2">strengthen existing copyright protections afforded to works made available online and to take swift and effective action against those who steal those works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p34"><FONT class="ft3">(7) In order to increase access to works, should publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives enter into licensing schemes with the publishers? Are there examples of successful licensing schemes for online access to library collections</FONT><FONT class="ft2">?</FONT></P>
<P class="p35"><FONT class="ft2">Yes. The best way for libraries to provide their patrons with the widest variety of online access to copyrighted works is through license agreements with the copyright owners of the relevant works. Many publishers already have such licensing arrangements with libraries. As discussed above, these agreements vary greatly in scope and type.</FONT></P>
<P class="p20"><FONT class="ft2">We have significant concerns with any regime that would allow libraries or others to allow remote or online access to copyrighted works without a license from the copyright owner authorizing the activity. For example, if a library was allowed to e-mail a copy of a copyrighted work or otherwise provide online access to a work, what would prevent that copy from being further distributed by the user or prevent the user from retaining the copy as a back-up copy?. Under a license agreement publishers and libraries would able to reach agreement on the security precautions and the other many, variable circumstances that could arise, to the benefit of both library users and publishers. Factors that must be considered would include: what the content is; what format is used to deliver the content; how the library delivers that content; who, how and when that content can be distributed; and how further re-distribution of copies provided to patrons through e-mail, the Internet or CD would be controlled by the library. The copyright law is not meant to address such specific factors &#8211; licenses are. It would therefore be ineffectual and inappropriate to attempt to encourage increased online access to copyrighted works by replacing existing and future licensing schemes with mandatory exceptions in the law.</FONT></P>
<P class="p36"><FONT class="ft3">(8) Should the scope of the exception for publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives be clarified with respect to: (a) Format shifting;</FONT></P>
<P class="p37"><FONT class="ft3">(b) The number of copies that can be made under the exception; (c) The scanning of entire collections held by libraries;</FONT></P>
<P class="p38"><FONT class="ft2">It is well recognized in the archival community that non-digital media&#8212;books, papers etc. &#8212; have issues of degradation that are certainly serious, if not more acute than that found in the current state of digital media. Consequently, it would appear that there exists a greater need for libraries to archive and preserve non-digital media than digital media. For these reasons, many publishers currently provide for archiving in their license or subscription access agreements (see examples in the response to Question 6 above). Of course circumstances may arise where there is no archiving provision in the agreement and access to and use of digital and non-digital works is precluded because of changes in technology or where a copy is lost or damaged. In that limited situation, it should be possible for a library to make a copy of the work, provided the work is no longer available at a reasonable price in </FONT><FONT class="ft3">any </FONT><FONT class="ft2">format. Any exception in this area should be limited to archival replacement and should not be interpreted to permit the creation of</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_7">

<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft2">additional copies or non-archival copies that could be distributed or accessed outside the library community.</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">We recognize that the software and hardware tools used to deliver and use digital content can be superseded in the market by other technologies. In some cases, the effective obsolescence of software and hardware can make access to digital works much more difficult. For this reason, SIIA has been a longtime supporter of the Open Document Format (ODF), which was designed to help address this very issue. The ODF initiative will ensure that the users&#8217; information is accessible as platforms and technologies change. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format avoid being locked into a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, changes its software, or changes its licensing terms to something less favorable for the user. ODF protects users from ever having to seek permission or pay a fee to any technology provider to access the libraries licensed works. Adoption of open standards is particularly important for governmental applications because they can effectively ensure that a government document saved today will not be technologically locked tomorrow. We believe that the ODF initiative will address most of the concerns libraries may have about being unable to access archived works because of incompatible or obsolete technologies or formats and thus, any revision to the law in this area would be unjustified.</FONT></P>
<P class="p40"><FONT class="ft2">[We address the question regarding scanning of entire collections is addressed directly below]</FONT></P>
<P class="p41"><FONT class="ft3">(9) Should the law be clarified with respect to whether the scanning of works held in libraries for the purpose of making their content searchable on the Internet goes beyond the scope of current exceptions to copyright</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">Scanning of copyright works is a form of copying and as such is generally prohibited under the Berne Convention and copyright laws of countries around the globe unless the copier has first obtained the copyright owner&#8217;s authorization to scan the work(s). The ultimate purpose of the scanning -- e.g., for indexing, cataloguing, searching or some other purpose -- should have no bearing on the ultimate determination that a copy is being made and that such activity requires the authorization of the copyright owner. As a result, any public or private initiative to scan entire collections of works must require that the copyright owner opt-in, rather than putting the onus on the copyright owner to opt-out of the initiative. We do not believe that there needs to be any further clarification in the law in this area. To the best of our knowledge no court has ever held that such large-scale scanning activities are not prohibited under copyright law.</FONT></P>
<P class="p42"><FONT class="ft3">(10) Is a further Community statutory instrument required to deal with the problem of orphan works, which goes beyond the Commission Recommendation 2006/585/EC of 24 August 2006</FONT></P>
<P class="p43"><FONT class="ft2">SIIA does not believe a community statutory instrument is required or appropriate at this time. We believe that further examination of the issue needs to take place for there to be a better understanding of, among other things: (1) the different effects an orphan work defense might have on different copyright industries; (2) best practices for identifying and locating copyright</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_8">

<P class="p44"><FONT class="ft2">owners; (3) various resources available in each member states for identifying and locating copyright owners; (4) the resources available in each member states for finding owners of different types of copyrighted work at issue; and (5) different standards for liability in each members state.</FONT></P>
<P class="p45"><FONT class="ft2">By way of background, SIIA members are both copyright owners and users of the copyrighted works of others. As such, they have an interest in supporting the wide dissemination and use of copyrighted works under established principles of copyright law. They also have considerable experience in seeking permission for the use of copyrighted works. SIIA&#8217;s members understand the problems that can arise when a copyright owner cannot be identified and located for purposes of obtaining necessary permissions, and would welcome changes that help to address those issues in a manner that conforms with international best practice and legal norms.</FONT></P>
<P class="p46"><FONT class="ft2">The issue here is how and under what circumstances a user of a copyrighted work should be permitted to lawfully use the work when the user cannot identify and locate the copyright owner for purposes of obtaining permission for such use. We propose that the solution is to limit legal remedies that a user would be subject to if that user could not, after a diligent search, identify and locate the copyright owner before commencing use of the work. If the copyright owner should come forward after such a use has commenced, the copyright owner would be entitled to a reasonable licensing fee or royalty. In these case the copyright owner should generally not be not be entitled to recover statutory damages, the user&#8217;s profits, or attorneys&#8217; fees. Nor should there be criminal penalties for such uses and in only limited instances should an injunction be allowed to issue. We oppose orphan works solutions that would establish a compulsory license regime, a formal registry or an escrow system that requires prepayment into a fund in the event the copyright owner steps forward later.</FONT></P>
<P class="p47"><FONT class="ft2">It is difficult to prescribe what constitutes a diligent search. Because we do not know what he future holds with regards to searchable databases and because there will be an infinite number of circumstances that may raise the orphan works issue, ultimately the standard will need to be flexible and applied on a case-by-case basis. However, because the diligent search standard is the crux of any orphan work defense, it is important that the diligent search standard be sufficiently clear and demanding to prevent misuse and ensure that only those acting in good faith to find the copyright owner in order to license the work are able to satisfy the standard.</FONT></P>
<P class="p48"><FONT class="ft2">While we think it is important to obtain clarity on liability for use of orphan works, we do not believe that the issue is ripe to be addressed by way of a community statutory instrument. In particular, since the aim of such an exercise would be to find an objective standard of what would constitute a diligent search, what is reasonable could depend very much on a variety of local circumstances, such as the maintenance of right holder registration information, risk of liability, and the existence of search tools which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consequently, any attempt at harmonizing the diligent search standard (or other standards in the law) by way of a community statutory instrument could have the unfortunate result of creating an objective diligent search standard that is much too low or too vague. Furthermore, because the</FONT></P>

<P class="p49"><FONT class="ft2">Rome I and II regulations,</FONT><FONT class="ft7">1 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">which deal with conflict of law situations, extend clarity to the cross- border use of copyright works harmonization does not seem appropriate at this time.</FONT></P>
<P class="p38"><FONT class="ft2">At the same time, however, we are in favor of encouraging consistency between standards being adopted by member states. We think more work needs to be done in this area to better understand the different capabilities and resources of member states relevant to locating and identifying copyright owners. Accordingly, we suggest a study to catalogue and compare the practices, sharing of best practices and exchanging information between the different jurisdictions that have been addressing the orphan works issue is a better way to go, rather than endorsing another community instrument such as a directive in the copyright context, or otherwise.</FONT></P>
<P class="p50"><FONT class="ft5">(11) If so, should this be done by amending the 2001 Directive on Copyright in the information society or through a stand-alone instrument</FONT></P>
<P class="p51"><FONT class="ft2">While we do not support such an approach, to the extent that an orphan works standard is adopted throughout the EU, we recommend that a Community statutory instrument dealing with the problem of orphan works should be a stand-alone instrument. As noted above, an orphan works defense would not be an exception to copyright infringement. The orphan works defense is a rights clearance mechanism that would merely serve to limit the legal remedies that a user would be subject to if that user was found liable for copyright infringement. Accordingly, a user of an orphan works owner is still deemed to be an infringer. Because the 2001 Copyright Directive relates to rights and exceptions, but not remedies, it would be inappropriate for the Directive to be amended to include a provision relating to orphan works.</FONT></P>

</DIV>
<DIV id="page_10">

<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft2">Yes. Over the years, there has been much progress on increasing and improving accessibility to copyrighted works by person with a disability through a combination of licensing schemes with publishers, authors and their agents and narrowly tailored legislative solutions. Stakeholders continue to engage in fruitful discussions in this area to expand and improve accessibility further and we remain confident that these discussions will facilitate such access. While publishers are receptive to these licensing schemes and to such limited exceptions in the copyright law allowing for the making of copies in a particular format for people with disabilities in certain circumstances, it is important that any exceptions in this area be narrowly tailored to address the specific accessibility problem and be directly connected to the person&#8217;s ability to read or hear copyrighted works. There are many physical disabilities that do not affect a person&#8217;s ability to view or hear a copyrighted work, and those persons should not be covered. It is also important that the law ensure that the rights of copyright holders to control further access to and distribution of these works remains intact.</FONT></P>
<P class="p55"><FONT class="ft2">One recently-created licensing scheme is the AccessText Informational Network, a membership information exchange network that will facilitate and support the nationwide delivery of electronic files for students with disabilities. AccessText operates as a conduit between the publishing world and post-secondary disability programs. AccessText is a nucleus of pre- and post-production electronic textbook file exchanges, training, technical support and informational resources. AccessText&#8217;s services will be guided by an advisory committee and AccessText members. It will enable publishers and DSS offices to more effectively use their respective resources to be more efficient, faster and better serve students who have purchased textbooks. One of AccessText&#8217;s goals is to enable institutions to more easily access needed e-text files, share end-user files, through efficient acquisition and distribution, and obtain permissions to scan hard copies of legally-acquired texts. The 2008 AccessText Services include: (i) access to a system that provides reliable historic data on textbook titles, formats, and a fulfillment time frame. (This service will help to reduce DSS expenditures through textbook procurement and post-production cost); (ii) access to an institutional membership verification process, which will reduce the cumbersome process of individual student verification; (iii) access to a web-based alternative media organizer for ordering, tracking and delivery distribution &#8211; a one-stop-shop; (iv) access to a technical assistance toll-free support line to provide data exchange support and membership verification; (v) access to an information exchange membership wiki (</FONT><FONT class="ft3">i.e</FONT><FONT class="ft2">., post production and assistive technology), and (vi) access to a membership suggestion and feedback collection area through the web portal.</FONT></P>
<P class="p56"><FONT class="ft3">(14) Should there be mandatory provisions that works are made available to people with a disability in a particular format</FONT></P>
<P class="p57"><FONT class="ft2">No. Mandating that copyright owners make their works available to people with a disability in a particular format constitutes a type of tax on copyright owners. While (as noted above) publishers are receptive to exceptions in the law allowing for the making of copies in a particular format for people with disabilities in certain circumstances, requiring that these publishers make such the works available themselves crosses the line, by placing the burden of this problem entirely on the shoulders of the publishing industry. In addition, mandating a particular format</FONT></P>

<P class="p58"><FONT class="ft2">through statutory changes in the copyright law could possibly preclude development and use of future processes and technologies that may prove a more effective solution to this problem.</FONT></P>
<P class="p59"><FONT class="ft5">(15) Should there be a clarification that the current exception benefiting people with a disability applies to disabilities other than visual and hearing disabilities</FONT></P>
<P class="p60"><FONT class="ft2">No. It is important that any exceptions in this area be directly connected to the person&#8217;s ability to read or hear copyrighted works. There are many physical disabilities that do not affect a person ability to view or hear a copyrighted work, and those persons should not be covered. SIIA understands that people with visual disabilities may require a different format that allows them to access the written words contained in a literary works (such as audio-based access for the blind) and those with hearing disabilities may require a different format that allows them to access audio works (such as text-based access for the hearing impaired). While we recognize these needs, we cannot conceive of other types of disabilities (not related to abilities to read or hear) that would warrant similar special treatment.</FONT></P>
<P class="p61"><FONT class="ft5">(16) If so, which other disabilities should be included as relevant for online dissemination of knowledge</FONT></P>

<P class="p62"><FONT class="ft3">(17) Should national laws clarify that beneficiaries of the exception for people with a disability should not be required to pay remuneration for using a work in order to convert it into an accessible format</FONT></P>
<P class="p63"><FONT class="ft2">No. As stated above, requiring that publishers make such works available to persons with a disability without remuneration crosses the line, by placing the burden of this problem entirely on the shoulders of the publishing industry. We acknowledge that the costs associated with conversion of copyrighted works into an appropriate format may be substantial in certain cases, but we so no reason why publishers should shoulder this burden alone by foregoing payment for their copyrighted works.</FONT></P>
<P class="p64"><FONT class="ft3">(18) Should Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases have a specific exception in favour of people with a disability that would apply to both original and sui generis databases?</FONT></P>

Therefore, as noted above, we would not object to the inclusion of a similarly narrowly-tailored exception for people with disabilities into the Directive on the legal protection of databases. Doing so may also provide the opportunity to improve the Directive in other areas, such as providing greater protections to those databases created outside the EU or to clarify &#8211; in the face of the European Court of Justice&#8217;s opinion in </FONT><FONT class="ft3">The British Horseracing Board Ltd and Others v William Hill Organization Ltd </FONT><FONT class="ft2">&#8211; that the Directive is</FONT></P>

<P class="p26"><FONT class="ft3">(19) Should the scientific and research community enter into licensing schemes with publishers in order to increase access to works for teaching or research purposes? Are there examples of successful licensing schemes enabling online use of works for teaching or research purposes</FONT></P>
<P class="p66"><FONT class="ft2">Yes. It benefits all stakeholders when publishers are able to enter into licensing schemes with the scientific and research communities. Many publishers are already engaged in these licensing activities and have been for many years. As noted in the answer to questions 1 - 5 above, publishers have been responsive to the needs of the scientific and research communities by making their copyrighted works available to these communities under numerous differing licensing models. As technology and needs change, publishers have shown a willingness to develop new licensing options in order to increase and improve access to their works for purposes of teaching and research. Some examples of successful licensing schemes enabling online use of works for teaching or research purposes include McGraw-Hill Primis custom publishing service; NAPC academic coursepack service entitled, &#8220;XanEdu,&#8221; and Copyright Clearance Center Academic Permissions Service.</FONT></P>
<P class="p13"><FONT class="ft2">It should be noted that whenever a license involves potential online use, especially when such use is directed at students, publishers become very sensitive to the potential risks to the value of their works. Online piracy is a tremendous problem for publishers. It is, therefore, essential that any licenses that provide for online access to works also include terms that adequately and effectively ensure the security of these works and protect them from being illegally disseminated or being used beyond the license terms. Appendix A includes a more detailed discussion of the types of technological protection systems and licenses that have been implemented, are available for implementation, or are proposed to be developed to protect digitized copyrighted works and prevent infringement.</FONT></P>
<P class="p67"><FONT class="ft2">SIIA and our members in particular have a significant interest in the use of technology in the educational environment.

<P class="p68"><FONT class="ft5">(20) Should the teaching and research exception be clarified so as to accommodate modern forms of distance learning</FONT></P>
<P class="p69"><FONT class="ft2">SIIA would not oppose new statutory clarification in EU copyright law as it regards use of copyrighted materials for purposes of distance education, and indeed the TEACH Act that has been in effect in the United States provides a good model for consideration</FONT></P>
<P class="p20"><FONT class="ft2">Educators, publishers and the high-tech industry have been partnering for more than two decades to bring the benefits of computer technology and technology-based applications to the classroom. While the integration of technology as a teaching tool has been a gradual process, students of all ages are reaping benefits at an exponential rate due to the increasing ubiquity of the Internet. As a result, the evolution of computer technology in the educational environment is revolutionizing educational perceptions, practices and structures. Technology is changing both the process, and the business, of education.</FONT></P>
<P class="p70"><FONT class="ft2">Technology can challenge long-standing education models by increasing choice and empowerment. It can also simultaneously expand and reduce risks associated with illegal re- distribution and misuse of copyrighted materials originally used for educational purposes. Responding to the potential of distance education and the need to protect proprietary content used in distance education programs and elsewhere, SIIA member companies and many other high-tech companies have made considerable technology investments in recent years.</FONT></P>
<P class="p71"><FONT class="ft2">Just as educational institutions have integrated technologies into teaching and learning to facilitate delivery of course curricula, they must also integrate technological protection systems into their distance education programs to protect copyrighted works used in those programs. This requirement was an essential component of the TEACH Act enacted in the United States.</FONT></P>
<P class="p72"><FONT class="ft2">Without the use of robust, effective technological protection systems, the copyrighted educational content used in distance education programs is likely to be illegally distributed and/or misused by students enrolled in the programs as well as others who may gain unauthorized access. When educators take advantage of new technologies to encourage students to use and access copyrighted content, they must keep in mind that end users generally do not know or do not care about protecting the copyrighted content.</FONT></P>
<P class="p73"><FONT class="ft2">Most (87.9 percent) of the college administrators from 632 institutions surveyed by Campus Computing reported having a written policy regarding software duplication. Despite the best intentions of these educational institutions, student software piracy rates remain high. A recent study by the </FONT><FONT class="ft3">Student Monitor </FONT><FONT class="ft2">found that, in 2002, 46% of college undergraduate students obtain their software illegally from family or friends. This number is down only slightly from the 2001, when 49% of college undergraduate students obtained their software illegally.</FONT><FONT class="ft7">2 </FONT><FONT class="ft2">The 2002 study also showed that 34% of the students visited Kazaa to acquire software or for other reasons.</FONT><FONT class="ft7">3</FONT></P>

<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft2">These studies show that it is essential that any copyrighted content used in distance education programs be protected by robust, effective technological protection systems. As any business can attest, technology costs are a dynamic budget item, requiring continued investment in infrastructure, software, support and training. Accordingly, institutions wishing to use copyrighted works in distance education programs should take steps to ensure that they: (1) use technological protection systems to protect any copyrighted content used in a distance education program; (2) budget for such technologies; and (3) continuously monitor the effectiveness and the success rate of the technology used.</FONT></P>
<P class="p75"><FONT class="ft2">To the extent the teaching and research exception is clarified so as to accommodate modern forms of distance learning such clarification should ensure that only a bona fide nonprofit educational institution may use a small portion of a copyrighted work in a distance education course to the same extent it might use such material in a live classroom setting. The exception does not give educators a blank check to use copyrighted works in their distance education programs. Educators must use technological measures to ensure that the work is only received by students enrolled in the course and to reasonably prevent those students from retaining the work for longer than the class session and from further distributing the work. This ensures that that the copyrighted work is used only for the limited purpose(s) intended by a particular distance education course and to prevent downstream piracy of the work. The educational institution should also take steps to ensure that the use of a copyrighted work does not exceed the use that would transpire in a live classroom setting. For example, the exception should not apply to any materials, such as textbooks and course packs, that are typically purchased by or for a student&#8217;s use. Similarly, the work must be specific to the subject of course study and not intended simply as background or supplementary material.</FONT></P>
<P class="p76"><FONT class="ft3">(21) Should there be a clarification that the teaching and research exception covers not only material used in classrooms or educational facilities, but also use of works at home for study</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">See response to Question 20.</FONT></P>
<P class="p77"><FONT class="ft5">(22) Should there be mandatory minimum rules as to the length of the excerpts from works which can be reproduced or made available for teaching and research purposes</FONT></P>
<P class="p78"><FONT class="ft2">As noted in responses to prior questions, due to changes in the publishing world brought about by digital technologies publishers are now able to offer their content in many different ways through many different license agreements. Many publishers will offer access to not only entire works, but also subsets of their works. For instance, several publishers license their works by individual articles, even individual chapters of a book, and sometimes by individual sections and words. Mandatory minimums rules regarding the length of excerpts from works that can be copied for teaching and research purposes could eviscerate these licensing models and actually result in works and excerpts being less accessible.</FONT></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_15">

<P class="p39"><FONT class="ft2">In addition, establishing minimum rules regarding the length of excerpts from works that can be copied for teaching and research purposes seems to contradict long-established rules for determining infringement. Specifically, in determining whether an infringement has occurred courts will look at whether a substantial part of the work has been copied. In analyzing this courts will look at both the quantity and quality of what was copied. The courts also tend to adhere to long standing policies for copying by educational institutions. It&#8217;s not clear why these long standing rules and policies for excerpts should no longer apply and minimum rules as proposed here should be used instead.</FONT></P>
<P class="p79"><FONT class="ft3">(23) Should there be a mandatory minimum requirement that the exception covers both teaching and research?</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">To the extent any exception covers research it must be made clear that such exception only applies to qualified individuals and not to &#8220;research&#8221; generally. Failure to do so would create a significant loophole in the law and invite abuse by bad actors. As noted above, any exception should only apply to students enrolled in the course and should reasonably prevent those students from retaining the work for longer than the class session and from further distributing the work.</FONT></P>
<P class="p80"><FONT class="ft4">Section 3.4: User-Created Content</FONT></P>
<P class="p81"><FONT class="ft3">(24) Should there be more precise rules regarding what acts end users can or cannot do when making use of materials protected by copyright</FONT></P>
<P class="p8"><FONT class="ft2">User-created content is not a new concept. Use of a copyrighted work implicates the copyright owner&#8217;s right to control the adaptation of his or her work. (This is often referred to as the right to create a derivative work or the modification right). When someone uses a copyrighted work to create a new copyrighted work there are three possible outcomes: (1) they are licensed by the copyright owner or otherwise permitted by some exception in the law to create a derivative work and therefore there is no infringement; (2) they are using such a small amount of the copyrighted work or nonprotectable aspects of the copyrighted work that the use does not implicate the copyright owner&#8217;s reproduction or adaptation rights under copyright law and therefore there is no infringement; or (3) they are not licensed by the copyright owner to create a derivative work and are using sufficient protectable expression from the copyrighted work that the use implicates the copyright owner&#8217;s reproduction and adaptation rights which results in an infringement. This has been the law for many years. Although, with the advent of new digital technologies, it may be easier than ever to create derivative works, there is no reason to change these long-standing, well-established copyright rules.</FONT></P>
<P class="p82"><FONT class="ft2">The issue of user-created content is primarily one of education. Until recently, most people did not have the capability to use someone else&#8217;s creation to create a new work. Copying was too difficult or expensive. As a result, your average person did not need to have even a rudimentary understanding of copyright rules. But now, anyone can be a publisher. It&#8217;s easy and inexpensive. While this presents great new possibilities, it also poses great challenges and risks</FONT></P>

<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft2">for copyright owners. Governments and educators need to do a better job educating the public on what they can and cannot do with copyrighted works. The public needs to better understand the purpose and goals of the copyright law and the sanctions for violating it. In short, the rules of the road do not need to be changed, the people who drive on the road need to better understand the rules.</FONT></P>

<P class="p85"><FONT class="ft14">The functionality provided by technological protection systems basically fall into three categories:</FONT></P>
<P class="p86"><FONT class="ft15">Access Control Functions</FONT><FONT class="ft2">: These functions control the user&#8217;s right of entry to the protected content, e.g., encryption and/or authentication.</FONT></P>
<P class="p87"><FONT class="ft15">Use Control Functions</FONT><FONT class="ft2">: These functions control how the user can interface with the protected content, e.g., read-only rights (the user is unable to print, save or distribute the content).</FONT></P>
<P class="p88"><FONT class="ft16">Tracking Functions</FONT><FONT class="ft14">: These functions allow the content provider to track the subsequent use and/or distribution of its content online, e.g., watermarking and digital footprints.</FONT></P>
<P class="p89"><FONT class="ft2">Within each type of protection system, there are varying degrees of protection. For example, different types of access control systems include:</FONT></P>

<P class="p90"><FONT class="ft2">A technological protection system may include one or more of these functions. For example, a certain technological protection system may incorporate password access controls and read-only use controls to prevent wrongful access and wrongful re-distribution of the protected product. To some extent access control and use control functions may also be overlapping. For instance, access controls also serve as use controls since a user who does not have access to the content may not use it.</FONT></P>

<P class="p15"><FONT class="ft2">Digital technology can now make it easier than ever before to secure online copyright protection in many context. Technological protection systems enable copyright protection, distribution, usage and payment for digital content such as text, music, images or software via any electronic medium. Many companies have emerged that provide core technology for technical protection systems or serve as clearinghouses for use permissions for copyrighted content. These entities deliver technological protection solutions that implement sophisticated rights and permissions business models, combined with a back-office rights clearance infrastructure for managing rights.</FONT></P>
